[15:54:28:22]
Yeah perfect.

[15:54:30:22]
That's exactly what I need.

[15:54:32:22]
At least it's not my back.

[15:54:34:22]
Alright man tell us your name and what do you do for a living?

[15:54:42:22]
I'm Dwayne Learing and I produce mix engineer play guitar kind of all the things.

[15:54:48:22]
I've been a very long career.

[15:54:50:22]
But mainly producing I'm a guitarist.

[15:54:52:22]
I'm a guitarist. play guitar kind of all the things.

[15:54:56:08]
It's been a very long career.

[15:54:57:21]
But mainly producing mixing a lot of that kind of stuff right now.

[15:55:01:15]
Nice tell me about some of the cool stuff you've worked on with that.

[15:55:05:00]
Oh it's been a lot.

[15:55:08:04]
Started off preacher's kid church music for a long time.

[15:55:11:07]
Ended up in pop music touring with people in the rock and roll world pop world.

[15:55:18:01]
As a guitar player and then started producing really early.

[15:55:22:21]
So I kind of balanced this world between the sacred and secular.

[15:55:28:23]
And so it's like a worship project or a hymns thing and a country record and an indie rock band.

[15:55:34:21]
And so it's honestly just all over the map which is kind of fun.

[15:55:38:04]
That's awesome.

[15:55:38:22]
Keeps it fresh.

[15:55:39:16]
That's awesome.

[15:55:40:14]
How'd you find your way to this Bob Joyce project?

[15:55:43:19]
Man well I had heard about this project because my friend John Hartley who had been contacted about potentially doing something with him we've worked together for 25 years do a lot together.

[15:55:57:11]
And we had just kind of wrapped up a recording the week before on another record.

[15:56:03:03]
And he said "Hey we got the session "at Dark Horse Studio in Franklin.

[15:56:07:00]
"You wanna come engineer it and like play on it?"

[15:56:09:06]
And we're tracking a band going and trying to get a couple songs in a day.

[15:56:12:22]
I was like "Yeah great."

[15:56:14:02]
But when he calls I just say yes.

[15:56:15:08]
So I'm like "Yeah didn't know anything about it." until I think the day before was like yeah so it's this guy Bob and yada yada yada.

[15:56:26:03]
Starts kinda telling me and he goes he kinda sounds like Elvis.

[15:56:29:11]
And I was like okay so what are we actually doing?

[15:56:33:11]
'Cause it was a lot of the guys that we normally use in the studio a lot of legendary guys it's all our friend group.

[15:56:38:04]
And he's like well we're gonna go in and record a couple songs with this guy and if he likes it we may end up doing an album.

[15:56:42:21]
So it's just kind of a test.

[15:56:43:17]
We get the band together and see if you know he's like he's an older guy.

[15:56:46:15]
So I was like okay cool.

[15:56:48:18]
Well if I'm driving then in the studio engineering I was like if that's what it is Adam would take it.

[15:56:55:05]
Like I just I'm not gonna play.

[15:56:56:18]
I'll just engineer it.

[15:56:57:14]
So I can kind of man the ship.

[15:56:59:13]
So didn't really know much more than that.

[15:57:01:11]
I was like oh guy sounds like Elvis.

[15:57:03:00]
You know what I mean?

[15:57:04:10]
And we went in fired the band up.

[15:57:07:09]
They come in and he played us a couple of songs.

[15:57:10:22]
And I was like yeah he does sound quite a bit like Elvis.

[15:57:13:12]
I kind of didn't really know what to think but in the heat of it I've got five musicians in different rooms I'm in front of the console calling "Okay cool."

[15:57:23:20]
We've all experienced a lot of different things in the music business and we've been doing it this long.

[15:57:28:14]
Everybody's got stories of like "Oh man you're sitting around having dinner one night "and you're like oh you're never gonna believe this.

[15:57:33:17]
"You know you're like check this out."

[15:57:35:18]
So everybody's got all kinds of stories.

[15:57:37:22]
So I was like "Well this is one for the books for sure."

[15:57:42:07]
So anyway I didn't think much about it. just doing a session and we get finished and they're talking they're like in the other room as I'm wrapping up some overdubs and with the other musicians and some last parts.

[15:57:53:17]
And so then we left he was like man they want to do a whole record and it'll be great.

[15:57:58:05]
I was like yeah it was fun.

[15:57:59:09]
It was like she's got some really cool songs and yeah why not?

[15:58:03:11]
You know what I mean?

[15:58:04:04]
Didn't think much of about it.

[15:58:05:15]
We're driving back and grabbed a bite to eat on the way home and he goes I don't think he's they think he's Elvis.

[15:58:13:21]
I went no I don't know.

[15:58:16:19]
He just sounds a lot like him but hey you know what I mean?

[15:58:20:04]
We're in the studios.

[15:58:20:23]
What we do you know?

[15:58:23:09]
And until about a day or so later one of the other guys-- we didn't tell anybody in the band because I didn't even know.

[15:58:31:06]
We kind of didn't fully know what we were walking into.

[15:58:34:16]
Well apparently one of the other guys in the band had been kind of pulled aside by someone else and really thought he was Elvis.

[15:58:41:03]
And he called me freaked out the next morning going dude like eight o'clock he woke me up but I was like he's never calls me that early so I'm like hey what's up and he tells me this whole thing and I was like no he really like they really said that like that I was like oh my gosh I can't wait to tell John this is gonna be great like we totally thought it was not a thing so it was kind of crazy well the funny thing is my mom had been calling me from the West Coast I didn't deny a bunch of calls because you know intense session where you know the whole day so call you tomorrow so I end up running some errands and I call her and she's like this is just after I'd had the phone call from one of the other band guys going they really think he's Elvis right so my mom's like oh how did how did the session go yesterday what were you doing I was like I was just a session I said actually you really want to know what I was doing I'll tell you what I was doing I said so there's this guy said you know we've done all kinds of crazy stuff I said there's this guy that people think he's actually Elvis like Elvis didn't die.

[15:59:47:12]
And she goes "Oh you mean Bob Joyce?"

[15:59:52:12]
And I went I'm literally walking into the grocery store in the morning and I'm walking out I go "Yeah Mom it's Bob Joyce."

[16:00:01:08]
Like how how do you know about Bob Joyce?

[16:00:06:08]
She's like "Oh my sister keeps sending me stuff and she was a huge fan you know She's my mom's oldest sister.

[16:00:13:05]
She's like "Do you really think it's him?"

[16:00:14:17]
And I was like "Mom no wait what?

[16:00:16:10]
I don't this no mom it's not him.

[16:00:19:01]
What are you talking about?"

[16:00:20:07]
She's like "Oh we've seen all the things and heard oh isn't that crazy?

[16:00:24:07]
Are you gonna do more with him?"

[16:00:25:11]
And I was like "Well yeah I think we're doing an album."

[16:00:28:09]
She's like "Oh that's so exciting."

[16:00:29:18]
She's like "What if it's him?

[16:00:31:01]
What if it's actually Elvis?"

[16:00:32:16]
I'm walking in a crowbar I'm like "Mom it's not Elvis okay?"

[16:00:37:07]
My whole brain's actually still just been blown an hour earlier on this phone call.

[16:00:42:12]
So I hang up the phone I'm like this is so crazy.

[16:00:47:01]
And then you know your phone's listening to you.

[16:00:49:06]
All of a sudden Bob Joy starts popping up.

[16:00:51:08]
It like feeds on like Instagram and these things.

[16:00:53:17]
I'm like this is crazy.

[16:00:55:10]
Like I'd never never heard of him.

[16:00:58:10]
Didn't know anything about it walking into the session.

[16:01:01:07]
So about a month later they came back and we booked a whole week and got players together and did the whole thing.

[16:01:05:12]
And I was like well it went well and it'll be fun.

[16:01:07:14]
It'll be great. and it'll be a story you know?

[16:01:10:17]
So anyway on that weekend before it I'm driving with one of my sons and he's like "Wow what are you up to this week Dad?"

[16:01:19:10]
I'm like "Oh I'm working at this studio over here in Franklin."

[16:01:22:11]
I said "I'm there all week."

[16:01:24:18]
And I said "It's actually a big tracking thing."

[16:01:26:22]
And he's just about he just turned 16.

[16:01:30:07]
And so he's like "Oh yeah what Dad does is cool now."

[16:01:33:00]
You know what I mean?

[16:01:33:20]
Kind of realizing like the music thing's actually kind of fun.

[16:01:36:21]
So he's like what are you doing?

[16:01:39:17]
I'm like well I'll tell you exactly what I'm doing.

[16:01:41:17]
I said it's kind of crazy right?

[16:01:43:07]
So we're driving in the car.

[16:01:45:13]
And I go I got this whole band together all these guys.

[16:01:48:00]
And I said there's this guy that people think is actually Elvis.

[16:01:53:04]
Elvis didn't die.

[16:01:55:01]
And he goes oh yeah.

[16:01:56:22]
Oh the silver haired guy's got like the gray beard like this gray beard and like in the hair.

[16:02:01:22]
And I look at him like-- he goes what's his name?

[16:02:05:13]
What's his name?

[16:02:06:03]
I just kind of like look over and I go "Bob Joyce?"

[16:02:09:12]
He goes "Yeah that's it yeah."

[16:02:12:10]
He goes "You think it's really Elvis?"

[16:02:13:19]
This is replaying again now with my you know at the time 15 year old son.

[16:02:17:14]
And I'm going "Oh my gosh how is this?"

[16:02:20:15]
I'm like "How do you know about it?"

[16:02:22:16]
He goes "Oh it's all over TikTok.

[16:02:24:01]
Like everybody thinks it's him."

[16:02:25:20]
He's like "Daw that's so cool.

[16:02:27:15]
What if it's really him?"

[16:02:28:16]
I'm going "Dude it's not him."

[16:02:31:05]
But I don't know.

[16:02:32:19]
So now at this point I'm like How am I the last person or one of the last people to hear about Bob Joyce in the middle of this record?

[16:02:38:03]
so It was very interesting from the first session to then you know month or so later going in for the whole week to kind of Start the record there was um a Lot of Bob Joyce talk that was kind of coming at me so it was a very interesting thing But I just it was just another session that got booked you know Immediately nothing.

[16:03:04:15]
Like it was just another big session we were setting up for the whole week.

[16:03:08:01]
We had like five or six musicians all the different rooms.

[16:03:10:08]
We were tracking it live going for a very you know just like a tradition like we're just going to capture the whole thing.

[16:03:15:19]
Get Bob sit around the piano come up with the arrangements the musicians they're writing charts and then go out and find the vibe.

[16:03:22:14]
You know kind of an old school way of doing it.

[16:03:24:22]
But we had talked about it enough where it was like okay well everybody thinks it's him. and the songs like have that vibe.

[16:03:33:23]
Let's just embrace it and let's just go with it and not try and do something that sounds like Elvis or like try and rip any specific songs off.

[16:03:42:10]
Let's just go with it and just have fun.

[16:03:45:02]
And so I didn't really think much about it you know.

[16:03:49:10]
We put the mic up and he started singing again and it was like it's kind of going through your mind.

[16:03:54:03]
You know like That's crazy.

[16:03:57:00]
It's really crazy.

[16:03:58:10]
Wow.

[16:03:59:00]
You know but also you're in the heat of it and you've you know you've got the huge console and the musicians and everything.

[16:04:05:05]
So you just you know head down and working.

[16:04:07:06]
But there was a kind of an entourage of people around that were like yeah that's that's the dude man.

[16:04:13:01]
I'm like yeah I do.

[16:04:14:13]
You know what I mean?

[16:04:16:02]
So I just didn't really think about it much.

[16:04:17:16]
You know what I mean?

[16:04:18:12]
And so but then you kind of start hearing stories and all these things you're like well look at this scar in his hand and look at this and he's you know these sayings and this laugh and these things.

[16:04:28:07]
And so you're kind of like in the middle of trying to pay attention to work and you're like well that's crazy.

[16:04:33:08]
But I mean the thing I was left with without a doubt was he's a really amazing guy and his family's incredible.

[16:04:39:08]
His wife's kids are super sweet.

[16:04:41:21]
Just a really kind person who's you know he's a pastor at a church there's some people from the church they're close friends.

[16:04:51:23]
There's obviously this whole thing kind of surrounding him.

[16:04:54:04]
But he was just a really great really great guy who wrote some cool music.

[16:04:58:15]
And the band there was a couple guys that we hadn't actually going into it that weren't on the first session.

[16:05:04:23]
And we hadn't actually one of the guys there was one guy that hadn't been there and one guy that had been there but we forgot to tell until we got to the session.

[16:05:14:06]
And so we're getting ready to start.

[16:05:17:15]
I'm like oh hey Matt hey come here.

[16:05:20:06]
I got to I got to tell you something real quick just so you know because there's a lot of people here.

[16:05:24:09]
And I'm like how is he going to react?

[16:05:25:14]
Is he going to be like this is crazy?

[16:05:27:17]
And I'm like so I kind of tell him the story.

[16:05:30:09]
He goes are you serious?

[16:05:32:14]
And I go that's a heart attack man.

[16:05:34:14]
He goes.

[16:05:36:07]
That's awesome.

[16:05:39:03]
He goes he goes let's just go there man.

[16:05:42:10]
I was like exactly right.

[16:05:44:05]
So he was in so then we finished the first day of tracking.

[16:05:47:12]
It's going great.

[16:05:48:12]
We're getting these songs.

[16:05:50:01]
It's the best band.

[16:05:50:20]
It's all the right players.

[16:05:52:00]
It's just this moment.

[16:05:53:02]
And it was as a creative and doing this a long time.

[16:05:54:23]
It was one of those moments where you like this is awesome.

[16:05:57:07]
We're making really great music.

[16:05:58:20]
About nine o'clock that night I start getting texts from him.

[16:06:01:20]
He's like "Man we're going down the wormhole.

[16:06:04:05]
We're watching all this stuff on YouTube with my family."

[16:06:06:22]
He's like "This is fantastic.

[16:06:08:14]
Have you seen this one?

[16:06:09:16]
Have you seen this one?

[16:06:10:19]
Have you seen this one?"

[16:06:12:08]
So it was one of those things that you thought about but you didn't think about.

[16:06:18:20]
You know what I mean?

[16:06:19:17]
Cause there was a job to do.

[16:06:20:22]
And so you know that first week got done and it was like okay cool.

[16:06:24:19]
Is he isn't he?

[16:06:25:22]
I don't know.

[16:06:26:13]
I have a lot of work to do to finish a record you know?

[16:06:29:12]
So um but there's been yeah there's been a lot of interesting things that you find out from there until when it was done.

[16:06:36:06]
Cause there's a lot of there's a lot of work.

[16:06:37:16]
You know what I mean?

[16:06:38:07]
Did he seem familiar with being in a studio or?

[16:06:41:13]
What did you think of sort of how he moved about with the other musicians?

[16:06:46:16]
Yes and no.

[16:06:48:16]
Like that was kind of the very interesting thing.

[16:06:50:16]
And that's what my buddy John and I you know was producing.

[16:06:54:16]
We were sitting kind of talking like "Do you... you're kind of like having little sidebars you know what I mean?"

[16:06:59:16]
As things are going on like does he... does he know how to work?

[16:07:04:15]
You know there's certain terminology musically and things like that.

[16:07:08:15]
I'm like you would think if it was so we're kind of like in between going if it was Elvis he would know what that was called or what that was you know.

[16:07:16:00]
But then you go oh maybe not.

[16:07:18:10]
I mean if he hasn't if it is him so we're just sitting around chatting you know what I mean at dinner afterwards you know or you know kind of sidebarring.

[16:07:25:23]
And it's like well if he hasn't done it since then it's very different to then.

[16:07:32:16]
Back then even in the later days the technology wasn't there.

[16:07:36:18]
They were recording all at the same time just a few tracks and he was in the room with the band singing.

[16:07:40:21]
I used to have a studio right across from RCAB the studio where yeah RCAB where he recorded most of his hits and the band would show up.

[16:07:49:13]
They're all in one room.

[16:07:50:10]
There's only a handful of microphones.

[16:07:51:21]
They mix themselves.

[16:07:52:20]
They're listening to each other in the room.

[16:07:54:18]
So of course he doesn't know how a mixer works with his headphones and this or maybe I don't know.

[16:07:59:00]
So you're kind of like in this battle of like is it is it not?

[16:08:01:17]
I I don't know but you know it's I mean it was a fun process.

[16:08:06:03]
It made it interesting.

[16:08:07:10]
So it made it kind of fun while we were making it that there was these people like talking in the other lounge.

[16:08:12:04]
They're like oh yeah that was a lot you know you're playing on Elvis's last record.

[16:08:15:19]
You know it's like wait what?

[16:08:17:14]
It was a fun energy you know but didn't really think about it too much especially in that moment you know.

[16:08:23:07]
Can you definitively say if he is or is not Elvis?

[16:08:26:08]
Man.

[16:08:28:13]
Uh...

[16:08:32:08]
The majority of the time I would definitively say no.

[16:08:37:22]
Because of what you know and there's enough things in your mind and especially I'm recording all of his vocals.

[16:08:44:22]
I'm working on them after the fact.

[16:08:46:05]
I've mixed the record done the whole thing.

[16:08:47:13]
I've listened to it intimately.

[16:08:49:18]
Um...

[16:08:52:06]
And I you know you kind of compare a bit and then you go "Uh I don't know."

[16:08:57:06]
But logic in my head says no there's no way.

[16:09:00:02]
But then you find out more of these things.

[16:09:04:07]
Now everybody around is talking about it because we're making this record right?

[16:09:07:14]
So I really don't it makes it tough you know and then to just find out that oh he had you know a surgery like a thyroid thing or some sort of surgery like seven years ago and then to hear some stuff before that surgery.

[16:09:20:03]
Okay that makes it more complicated.

[16:09:24:05]
I don't know man.

[16:09:26:02]
I really don't know.

[16:09:26:22]
You know the one thing I do know is that it's now been proven over time that there's a lot that we've been told in our lifetimes about history about past events about different things that are what people wanted us to know.

[16:09:46:10]
How certain wars were started politics religion you look at all these different things that are kind of pushed around and it's like No here's the store.

[16:09:55:13]
It's kind of the matrix vibe right?

[16:09:57:12]
And now we're in a place where a lot of people are waking up to all these different things in life that are happening.

[16:10:01:20]
They go oh wait a minute that's not what I believed my entire life.

[16:10:04:15]
So is it or is it not?

[16:10:07:10]
I don't know man.

[16:10:09:04]
But it's really tough.

[16:10:10:18]
It makes it really tough.

[16:10:11:20]
And my logical side is like obviously no.

[16:10:16:20]
But I actually have heard crazier things. to be honest I've heard much crazier things.

[16:10:25:08]
I don't know we'll see.

[16:10:28:03]
Is that the coolest thing about it?

[16:10:29:11]
Is none of us gonna go--  I don't think yeah you know yeah.

[16:10:34:06]
And around him he doesn't seem like him but he's just a kind very gentle you know person who's really cool and he's great to work with.

[16:10:47:08]
So I'm like great we're making music.

[16:10:49:09]
It's very interesting.

[16:10:53:04]
The ultimate power of Bob Joyce is that whether most people tend to they don't forget is he or isn't he but they stop caring.

[16:11:02:19]
'Cause of who Bob is.

[16:11:05:02]
Absolutely I've seen that with people that are kind of around the situation where it's like it's not so much like oh my gosh it's Elvis.

[16:11:13:17]
Like he actually has this magnetism where he really cares about people and they care about him and he's pastoring this church and he's telling people about Jesus and he has this mission.

[16:11:23:23]
And regardless of the whole thing he's doing that as a preacher and he's pointing them to Jesus and then he sings and it's like you know what I mean?

[16:11:33:11]
But as okay so say it's not he's leaving a great legacy and he's making a mark you know what I mean?

[16:11:41:20]
And I haven't heard him say if he is or isn't.

[16:11:44:17]
And I heard even from inside the family just different you know things.

[16:11:49:16]
I think either way he's doing something great.

[16:11:54:02]
You know I'm I am very curious though.

[16:11:57:19]
I am very curious. (laughs)  Were there moments when you were going through his vocals that you would certainly lean a little more into the maybe pile on that one?

[16:12:09:10]
There were times there were definitely times where it was like holy cow that's him.

[16:12:16:11]
And then three seconds later I'd be like no it's not.

[16:12:19:12]
There's no way.

[16:12:21:02]
But again like I said just finding out that there was a surgery that can you could potentially completely lose your voice from.

[16:12:28:17]
So I'm like he doesn't have the power in the high range which was Elvis would you know what I mean?

[16:12:33:19]
He'd be batten down the hatches and hit this power that's coming from with them.

[16:12:38:09]
It's just like real deep and he just had this power.

[16:12:40:23]
Bob doesn't have that.

[16:12:41:19]
Well I'm like you know whether he's 89 or whatever age he is most people don't have that still. you know so that surgery thing was like that.

[16:12:51:06]
And then hearing a couple things actually today from before the surgery I don't know what to say or think about that right now.

[16:13:00:17]
Honestly that was really that's not what I heard but it totally makes sense because I've been you know I mean I've worked with some of the greatest singers alive in pop music and Christian music.

[16:13:10:20]
And I can tell when people are trying to access something that's not there when they're singing around maybe a rough spot in their voice and I can hear when people are doing these things.

[16:13:22:03]
So for me it's like oh he's going there but there's an element that's missing.

[16:13:28:05]
Is it age?

[16:13:29:01]
Is it surge?

[16:13:29:21]
Like these things.

[16:13:30:19]
So I don't know but hearing that track a minute ago was like that sounded a lot like Elvis.

[16:13:38:13]
You know what I mean?

[16:13:40:14]
But I don't know man.

[16:13:42:15]
I can't say yes or no and I'm fine with that.

[16:13:45:18]
Could it be?

[16:13:46:14]
Like I said I've heard of much stranger things being true.

[16:13:52:18]
He's fun to make music with and we're having a good time.

[16:13:57:07]
And he honors the band and everybody involved.

[16:14:00:04]
The band's having a blast they're amazing players.

[16:14:01:23]
We get to make some great music which in this line of work that's all you wanna do.

[16:14:06:09]
Do the musicians have a good time with him?

[16:14:08:01]
'Cause he plays a lot of music but he plays in church every week.

[16:14:12:13]
Yeah. you get a bunch of you know true I guess industry professionals in the room.

[16:14:19:11]
And I think it's sort of like you know you ever wrestled someone who doesn't know how to wrestle?

[16:14:23:07]
Just to hit in the eye.

[16:14:24:10]
Absolutely.

[16:14:25:02]
Yeah.

[16:14:26:00]
Well and so he would sit down on the piano and play the song out.

[16:14:29:11]
And everybody would sit around and the kind of session leader the bass player would sit and he would make the charts and they go Hey oh this chord is different in that section than you play it here.

[16:14:38:04]
What are we going to do to kind of refine it?

[16:14:39:13]
I mean we had a keyboard player that would play piano so he didn't have to sit and play the whole time.

[16:14:44:00]
But the piano player would kind of take on the style of how Bob was playing it and then kind of filter and fit it in because he's he'd only played these songs on piano or just with people at his church.

[16:14:56:01]
So you could tell there was definitely kind of an electricity and excitement when the band fired up and even on the first take as we're just kind of massaging and finding things railing through the speakers is sounds like a record with top-level musicians here in Nashville that have played with everyone.

[16:15:13:03]
I mean all the top names.

[16:15:14:18]
So they're industry legends quite literally and so first take is coming through and just this electricity in the room just see is kind of like grin and heading on him like you cool Bob you like that he's like oh yeah sounds real good real good you know what I mean so and then he kind of like oh correct maybe you know and something like I wanted it to be a bit more you know like this or this ending or no that's not the chord and he had trouble kind of saying what the chord was.

[16:15:40:06]
He'd go "Oh I'll just come show you."

[16:15:42:02]
You know what I mean?

[16:15:42:22]
So we like...

[16:15:43:17]
But he hadn't presented what he wanted.

[16:15:46:08]
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

[16:15:47:07]
Yeah definitely.

[16:15:48:22]
But he loved that the band was able to take and in that room we were able to take his idea and then kind of expand on it.

[16:15:55:14]
You know what I mean?

[16:15:56:10]
So that love of that was there.

[16:15:57:13]
So either way you could tell he was used to playing with some people in his church in Arkansas and now he's in Nashville with some of the top guys.

[16:16:04:08]
You know so it was there was a really There was a great atmosphere in the studio and all the musicians loved it.

[16:16:09:20]
You know what I mean?

[16:16:10:16]
He was really great with everyone.

[16:16:12:03]
That's cool.

[16:16:12:23]
Was it fun for you to do this style album?

[16:16:14:23]
Absolutely I mean completely different than anything you normally work on now.

[16:16:19:22]
Like I said it's everything from hip hop and pop to country to gospel to hymns.

[16:16:25:18]
Like you work on everything.

[16:16:27:20]
And so you know it's not a lot of times anymore that you get to go in and spend days on end with an actual band and really capture something on the floor live.

[16:16:37:19]
So yeah it was quite refreshing.

[16:16:40:00]
And even just kind of like mixing it and putting the pieces together it was like well let's just embrace what it is or what you know certain songs felt like different kind of maybe Elvis eras.

[16:16:52:06]
So I was like let's just embrace that.

[16:16:53:13]
It's kind of a 50s thing you know let's get these singers in because that was more the vibe.

[16:16:57:21]
And then let's take this one a bit more here.

[16:16:59:11]
And then there's kind of a 70s ballad thing.

[16:17:01:10]
And then you know and then the kind of 60s you know 68 special kind of like that kind of rip raw and just that energy that he had.

[16:17:08:10]
So it was fun to just go I just embrace it.

[16:17:11:09]
And you know he dug it.

[16:17:13:09]
So you know he was happy in the end and that's you know do it in this line of work.

[16:17:18:09]
That's what you you know that's what you aim for.

[16:17:20:09]
So yeah it was good fun.

[16:17:21:15]
Real good fun.

[16:17:22:09]
That's awesome.

[16:17:23:09]
Awesome.

[16:17:24:09]
Do you have any questions?

[16:17:25:09]
No?

[16:17:25:09]
No you crushed it.

[16:17:26:09]
It is so insightful interesting authentic.

[16:17:31:05]
Yeah I can't tell you if he is or isn't.

[16:17:33:09]
I don't know.

[16:17:34:10]
I hear more and more things where I go really?

[16:17:38:07]
It's like I said it's like the Arsenio Hall thing.

[16:17:40:09]
Things that make you go hmm.

[16:17:41:18]
Things make you say hmm yeah that segment.

[16:17:43:13]
I was a kid watching that a young teenager.

[16:17:45:15]
And that's immediately what I thought about.

[16:17:47:00]
Every time I hear something else I go I just see Arsenio Hall going things that make you say hmm.

[16:17:52:10]
I don't know.

[16:17:54:13]
It's very bizarre.

[16:17:55:13]
It's bizarre right?

[16:17:56:13]
But he's not which is the cool thing.

[16:17:58:20]
You know what I mean?

[16:17:59:20]
He's least interested in this than everybody else.

[16:18:01:22]
The absolute least.

[16:18:02:22]
And there's some people that really believe like with everything in them and it's a point where it's almost like a little uncomfortable but they're amazing people and they're real people and they're not simple.

[16:18:15:01]
They're not like crazy.

[16:18:17:02]
They're successful people that are like really great and it's like but they're like man.

[16:18:22:07]
And like I said or I think like you said even if he wasn't it's not like he's taking advantage of whatever he's actually really using whatever this platform is to invest in people and appoint people to Jesus.

[16:18:38:07]
So I'm kinda like okay cool man.

[16:18:40:05]
It was an enjoyable process and I'd do it again.

[16:18:42:03]
I think we may end up doing some more stuff which is great.

[16:18:45:14]
That's fantastic.

[16:18:47:10]
Awesome.

[16:18:48:06]
Fantastic interview.

[16:18:49:15]
Let's get it.

[16:18:50:11]
I love the mom and son story. (laughing)
