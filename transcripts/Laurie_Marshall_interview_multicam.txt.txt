[15:52:37:17]
Okay.

[15:52:38:14]
Will you go ahead and roll the camera for me?

[15:52:41:04]
Yeah.

[15:52:42:00]
Before you do that let me just hear your mic check.

[15:52:49:10]
Oh mic check check check.

[15:52:53:03]
Okay tell us your name and do the clap before.

[15:52:55:13]
I'm Lori Marshall.

[15:52:56:23]
Excellent fine good start. (laughing) Okay so tell us your name where you're from and how you started coming to Benton.

[15:53:12:21]
I'm Lori Marshall from Weatherford Oklahoma.

[15:53:17:17]
I was just scrolling I guess Facebook or YouTube or something and a video came up from Matt Joyce and Bob Joyce in a little I guess restaurant where Bob was doing American Trilogy.

[15:53:37:20]
And I was like in awe.

[15:53:41:10]
And my husband was like "Are you listening to Elvis?"

[15:53:45:12]
I said "Well I really don't know."

[15:53:47:20]
And I took it over there to him.

[15:53:49:00]
He said "That sounds just like Elvis."

[15:53:51:11]
I said "I know."

[15:53:52:08]
And so I kind of dug in and started looking for other videos.

[15:53:57:08]
And anyway I told my niece who lived there I said "You need to go with me.

[15:54:03:21]
We're going to go to Benton Arkansas."

[15:54:05:11]
So we did.

[15:54:06:11]
And -- So you went down the Internet rabbit hole like everybody else?

[15:54:10:11]
Yes.

[15:54:11:11]
Yes.

[15:54:12:11]
All right.

[15:54:13:11]
And what did you find when you first came here?

[15:54:16:11]
Your first trip here.

[15:54:17:11]
My -- our first -- we were so excited of course you know driving.

[15:54:21:03]
It takes about six hours I guess.

[15:54:24:11]
And when we walked in the door there weren't that many people here back then but we found us a seat and sat down and Bob came in and anyway it was just exciting.

[15:54:38:18]
I don't know we just watched every move he made and afterwards he walked up to us or it could have been before I don't know it was it was really neat but anyway he walked up and shook our hands and was very friendly and you just he just I mean there's an excitement about him.

[15:54:59:04]
So I still wasn't really sure but we went to lunch afterwards and talked to him and you just know I mean there's just a feeling.

[15:55:12:04]
Yeah just a feeling.

[15:55:14:04]
Yeah.

[15:55:15:04]
So were you a big Elvis fan?

[15:55:18:04]
Not really but I became one in '77.

[15:55:25:03]
I was 16 and I think I just got saved like that July.

[15:55:31:03]
And in August early August I had three consecutive dreams.

[15:55:37:03]
They were all of it's like a picture frame showed up in front of my face taste and an oval picture frame and a blurry figure was talking to me and he said "Don't cry don't be upset.

[15:55:54:11]
He's with me doing my work."

[15:55:58:16]
And I had that dream like three nights in a row and I woke up went into the living room and on the news they said "Alphys Presley has passed away."

[15:56:09:18]
I just sat down and started crying because it all came together.

[15:56:13:18]
At the time I had the dreams it was like "Okay okay."

[15:56:17:17]
I didn't know exactly what it was about until that moment.

[15:56:24:17]
I did cry.

[15:56:26:17]
But after I found the video and I dug into it I started thinking about the dream.

[15:56:37:17]
I thought that is not the meaning how I interpreted it.

[15:56:42:12]
It was it's okay.

[15:56:46:20]
He's with me doing my work.

[15:56:49:06]
He's not with me in heaven because he's still doing work for me.

[15:56:54:12]
And so that's how I take it now.

[15:56:56:10]
What has tell me about Pastor Bob as a pastor tell me about his service about what you like about the church?

[15:57:07:05]
Of course I like the people but Bob's sermons are relatable to everyone.

[15:57:16:05]
Of course he preaches Jesus and I'm a Baptist so he just preaches the Word from the Bible King James Bible.

[15:57:28:04]
Bible.

[15:57:29:16]
He always has a salvation message and how to walk closer with God and just it's just really good.

[15:57:41:22]
I don't know how to explain it.

[15:57:43:16]
Just something that we need to get us through the week.

[15:57:47:04]
Something that encourages us.

[15:57:49:16]
So how many times have you been to the church now?

[15:57:56:16]
I think it was May 2021 we come about once to twice a month.

[15:58:07:16]
So I do.

[15:58:08:16]
Yeah.

[15:58:09:16]
So.

[15:58:10:16]
Do you have a place to stay here or are you just staying in hotels?

[15:58:13:16]
Either with friends or hotel.

[15:58:15:16]
Yeah.

[15:58:16:16]
Do you have the necklace on today?

[15:58:18:16]
I can't tell.

[15:58:19:16]
I do.

[15:58:20:15]
Yes.

[15:58:21:15]
Tell me about your necklace.

[15:58:22:15]
It's a TCB necklace taking care of business in a flash.

[15:58:27:15]
My sister is married to a big Elvis fan and he bought her one years ago and it was one from his personal jeweler and I've always wanted one always.

[15:58:41:01]
And just since I started going to church I bought mine.

[15:58:43:01]
I wear it every day every night.

[15:58:44:20]
I never take it off.

[15:58:45:20]
Has Pastor Bob seen your necklace?

[15:58:48:20]
Yes he has.

[15:58:50:20]
Has he commented on your necklace?

[15:58:52:20]
No he hasn't.

[15:58:53:19]
I offered it for him to wear at one time when he was having his picture made and he said "I don't need a necklace."

[15:58:59:19]
What's your relationship with Pastor Bob?

[15:59:05:19]
I think it's pretty good.

[15:59:11:07]
Like everyone has said he's very friendly and caring and he looks at you you know looks in your eyes when he talks to you.

[15:59:24:03]
I always try to give -- get a hug from him.

[15:59:27:14]
I tell him I need a bob hug.

[15:59:29:13]
So usually before I go home I get one.

[15:59:33:04]
So I have heard and maybe it was directly from you you slip up more than others in front of Bob.

[15:59:41:04]
Yes I do.

[15:59:42:04]
I can't help it.

[15:59:45:04]
Can you give me an example of maybe when you've slipped up in front of Bob?

[15:59:49:04]
Well it's usually at lunchtime because we're all sitting around a table and sometimes he's just looking at me and I'm like Do I need to say something?

[16:00:01:03]
I don't know.

[16:00:02:03]
So I just ended up kind of blurting something out.

[16:00:06:03]
Like one time I was watching a movie the night before and I said "Bob I watched a movie last night."

[16:00:15:03]
And he said "You did?

[16:00:16:04]
What'd you watch?"

[16:00:17:03]
I said "Well it was a movie about this cowboy."

[16:00:20:03]
I said "He was a nice-looking cowboy and this other cowboy who was not so nice."

[16:00:28:03]
I said "Do you know Mr. Edwards?"

[16:00:30:03]
I said "I'll never watch him again."

[16:00:33:03]
I said "He really upset me."

[16:00:35:03]
He goes "What did he do?"

[16:00:37:03]
I said "He put a Brandon iron to this cowboy's neck."

[16:00:41:03]
I said "Do you know what I'm talking about?"

[16:00:43:02]
He goes "Yes I do."

[16:00:45:02]
And then he just went on to say that he also was in another Michael Landon show And I just kind of blurted out "Oh yeah you bought a sports car from Michael Landon didn't you?"

[16:00:59:15]
And he goes "I did."

[16:01:02:14]
But yeah.

[16:01:05:16]
And then I just kind of turned off and think "Why did I do that?"

[16:01:09:02]
So after lunch I said "Bob I am so sorry.

[16:01:13:08]
I shouldn't have said anything that I said."

[16:01:15:02]
He goes "No it's okay.

[16:01:16:14]
Don't you worry about it."

[16:01:17:14]
I said "I don't know."

[16:01:18:14]
I said "I shouldn't have done it."

[16:01:19:14]
He goes "No really.

[16:01:20:14]
It's okay." it's okay.

[16:01:24:06]
So is it do you feel like you hang out with Elvis or Pastor Bob or both?

[16:01:28:14]
I think it's Pastor Bob.

[16:01:37:10]
I mean I know in my heart that he was Elvis.

[16:01:42:10]
I don't think if he came out and said I'm Elvis I don't think I could call him Elvis.

[16:01:46:20]
I think I would have to call him Pastor Bob because he's a pastor and a very good one and I know he gave his heart over to God back in 77 and I don't know but I still know who it is and I'm still It still makes me excited.

[16:02:06:13]
I mean I can't hide that.

[16:02:09:13]
So yeah.

[16:02:12:13]
That's great.

[16:02:14:13]
Do you have any thoughts or theories as to why Elvis would have chosen to go into hiding and leave that life of fame?

[16:02:23:12]
I think it just got too much for him.

[16:02:25:12]
He couldn't live a normal life.

[16:02:30:12]
So much demands on him. on him you know people just had so many demands on him.

[16:02:35:02]
And I would have felt like I just can't breathe you know I have to get out.

[16:02:40:21]
So there may have been a lot more technical stuff like mafia I don't know I don't know what all what's going on in his life but I just feel like he was ready for a normal life you know to That's it.

[16:03:02:00]
And I think God finally got a hold of him.

[16:03:04:14]
I think he got a hold of him and you know he's like gave his life over completely to him so that yeah he could do God's work.

[16:03:20:06]
Do you excitedly tell other people about this church?

[16:03:24:07]
I do but it doesn't profit me.

[16:03:29:06]
I mean they think I'm silly.

[16:03:31:13]
Really?

[16:03:32:01]
Yeah.

[16:03:32:20]
When I tell them about the church but especially who the pastor is.

[16:03:38:14]
So my family don't believe.

[16:03:42:10]
So just my niece.

[16:03:44:18]
Yeah.

[16:03:45:06]
But it's like you have to come and see for yourself.

[16:03:49:11]
You have to feel the spirit in the church.

[16:03:51:08]
You have to feel-- Bob has a presence about him that Alva's had.

[16:03:56:22]
I mean I don't know what to call it. but you can feel the electricity you know when you meet him when he starts to sing.

[16:04:04:12]
And he's very shy in the mornings.

[16:04:07:02]
And then when he gets behind the piano and he starts the music he comes out.

[16:04:12:17]
I mean he gets filled with Holy Spirit and it's awesome.

[16:04:16:09]
I don't know.

[16:04:21:00]
But yeah you have to see.

[16:04:22:14]
And Bob says too you know you come here for one reason.

[16:04:27:05]
You just have to see but what you get is Jesus.

[16:04:31:12]
And I like that.

[16:04:32:14]
I like that when he says that.

[16:04:33:14]
He says that a few times during service.

[16:04:37:05]
You do you get Jesus.

[16:04:38:15]
So.

[16:04:39:11]
Good?

[16:04:43:20]
I think so.

[16:04:45:20]
Are there any stories you're willing to share that maybe things Pastor Bob has said or things that are interesting and just make you pause and go huh?

[16:04:56:12]
If you weren't a believer for example if I was sitting at lunch and I didn't believe that Pastor Bob was Elvis are there things that I could pick up on maybe a story he would tell that would make me?

[16:05:06:21]
A lot of times he tells when he was young you know when in a church a Pentecostal type church like Elvis was raised in there are stories at lunch one time he told a story about being in Germany And this is a poor man in Germany Pastor Bob with a video camera of his own.

[16:05:30:20]
And he goes to Holland I believe he said and he's videoing this miniature town.

[16:05:37:20]
He was just kind of reminiscing and there was this miniature town and he got videos of it.

[16:05:43:20]
And he said "I'm looking through the video taking pictures and all of a sudden this toddler walks by.

[16:05:49:20]
It's like the invasion of the toddlers but he was talking about that story.

[16:05:56:20]
And just I don't know.

[16:06:00:20]
For someone that doesn't know anything about Elvis what's the significance of Germany?

[16:06:05:19]
Elvis was in the service in Germany and so was Bob.

[16:06:11:19]
He talks about being in the service and he went to Germany.

[16:06:17:19]
He talks about going to Rome I believe he's been in Rome and I don't know I can't afford to go to Rome.

[16:06:26:19]
You know but I think the main thing is he's so down to earth and you enjoy just being around him but yeah you're going to pick up on stories that he's saying and if you think about it How could he do that with such a limited budget?

[16:06:50:18]
One time his wife was talking about how he got his guitar stolen in the back of a car.

[16:07:01:18]
Him and his brother-in-law were chasing the man.

[16:07:06:18]
Anyway they never got it back.

[16:07:09:18]
But she said it was just a cheap little guitar but that's what he had.

[16:07:16:18]
So it doesn't take much digging to see there's a lot of comparisons out there between Wilina Pastor Rob's wife and the woman Elvis is pictured with in Germany.

[16:07:26:18]
Oh you can tell they are the same person.

[16:07:29:17]
Does Wilina ever hint or say anything that might?

[16:07:32:17]
No she's just said she was in Germany and she's been a male person.

[16:07:39:17]
She was there and I think she was when she came back to the States but no she doesn't.

[16:07:48:17]
So there's not a lot of talking about their past but if a story comes up it doesn't end up that well right?

[16:07:55:17]
Right yeah.

[16:07:56:23]
Yeah they don't talk about that.

[16:08:00:17]
And clearly both Pastor Bob and Wilena have to know that this theory is around even though it's not talked about they have to know that people believe this.

[16:08:10:16]
Do you think they welcome it or do they oppose it or are they neutral?

[16:08:14:16]
Before I came I thought they really opposed it and you know you couldn't say anything.

[16:08:18:16]
And of course I wouldn't say anything to either one of them I know you know but I don't know.

[16:08:25:16]
They're just really sweet loving people.

[16:08:28:16]
I think they just kind of accept it.

[16:08:31:05]
They don't They won't add to a story like that like there have been people that come in with Elvis shirts on and and stuff Yes more so now than back in so when I found out yes Yes.

[16:08:58:07]
And would you say that the facts that you see whether it's the physical comparisons or the voice or different things have those things been validated for you personally?

[16:09:08:23]
Oh yes the voice when he starts singing.

[16:09:14:04]
I mean I just get chills all over.

[16:09:16:21]
You can just feel it especially how great thou are.

[16:09:20:13]
It's a great song.

[16:09:24:13]
Yeah he's got marks like where well it's on this hand like when Elvis did karate he had that big huge wound on his hand.

[16:09:37:10]
He still has a scar from that a darker spot.

[16:09:43:05]
There's the crease in his elbow and there's another little dimple here that Bob has that Alva's head.

[16:09:53:08]
Just the way he talks the way he says things the way he moves.

[16:09:57:18]
Oh yes definitely the way he moves.

[16:10:03:08]
Yes.

[16:10:07:05]
My last question for you is that do you think that with this story as it continues to develop out there in social media and online and obviously it's going to attract more people and seeing who Pastor Bob is do you think it helps or hurts?

[16:10:22:19]
I think it helps for him as far as getting people saved.

[16:10:29:13]
And I'm kind of mixed on it.

[16:10:33:16]
I was mixed about doing this interview.

[16:10:35:21]
I don't know who it will bring in you know.

[16:10:41:15]
I just pray for his safety of course and his health.

[16:10:44:22]
And I kind of don't want to share him.

[16:10:49:22]
You know I'm enjoying this part of my life and getting to know the man that he is.

[16:10:57:22]
And I don't want to share him.

[16:11:00:21]
But you know if that's what God wants then it's going to happen.

[16:11:06:21]
So Bob's number one thing is just to get people saved.

[16:11:11:21]
So.

[16:11:16:21]
It's great.

[16:11:17:23]
It's good.

[16:11:18:06]
It's fantastic.

[16:11:18:21]
I don't know.

[16:11:19:22]
I feel like I'm really -- ugh.

[16:11:21:21]
You did great.

[16:11:22:21]
You were wonderful.

[16:11:24:21]
Nicely done.

[16:11:26:21]
You come across very polished and very --
