[15:54:02:09]
[ Silence ]

[15:54:10:09]
And you're going to be speaking directly in the lens.

[15:54:14:04]
And just this first part just give us your name and clap around.

[15:54:18:13]
My name is Peggy Gordon.

[15:54:19:16]
Perfect.

[15:54:21:03]
Get that thing out of there.

[15:54:22:22]
Thank you much.

[15:54:24:21]
And again everything will just be in the lens if it's comfortable.

[15:54:30:19]
Okay I'm gonna read it to you.

[15:54:33:10]
Peggy tell us where do you live and how long have you been attending the church?

[15:54:40:00]
I live in Batesville Mississippi and I have been attending the church seven years.

[15:54:46:01]
Wow okay.

[15:54:47:01]
How far away is that from where you live?

[15:54:49:11]
Approximately three and a half hours one way.

[15:54:52:17]
And how often do you attend?

[15:54:56:09]
Every Sunday every weekend if I'm not visiting my children.

[15:55:00:23]
You visit the church every single Sunday and it's three and a half hours away.

[15:55:06:02]
Yes.

[15:55:07:06]
For seven years.

[15:55:08:14]
That's where God led me.

[15:55:09:23]
So how did you find your way to the church?

[15:55:13:03]
My sister Bonnie well let me get back.

[15:55:16:19]
My husband was a pastor and he had passed gone to heaven.

[15:55:21:17]
And I stayed on at the church for three years and I was still at the church because I had to get pastors every Sunday to preach.

[15:55:30:04]
I taught a Sunday school class.

[15:55:32:06]
I also played the piano.

[15:55:33:22]
I sang and paid the bills.

[15:55:37:03]
And she called me one day my sister Bonnie and she said "I listened to this pastor on YouTube "Bob Joyce and I'd like for you to listen to him.

[15:55:49:03]
"It's really really really good."

[15:55:51:10]
And the name of the sermon was "Come Out of the Shadows."

[15:55:55:02]
So I said "Well I will when I get time."

[15:55:58:02]
So I don't know how long it was before I found the video and listened to it.

[15:56:04:05]
And I knew right off that he was anointed with the Holy Spirit.

[15:56:09:06]
It was amazing you know to hearing it the video you know that you could tell.

[15:56:14:08]
I could because you know Christ is my everything.

[15:56:18:16]
So she said it was a year to the date that I called her.

[15:56:22:18]
I listened to that video one year later.

[15:56:25:16]
And I called her and asked her would she like to go to Arkansas to listen to that pastor preach.

[15:56:32:02]
And her husband had been deceased long before mine.

[15:56:35:12]
And she said "Sure."

[15:56:36:08]
I said "Well I'll get us a room."

[15:56:38:16]
So here we go.

[15:56:40:19]
It was three little rooms behind the Pizza Hut.

[15:56:44:08]
Had two baths.

[15:56:46:04]
And it was about 10 11.

[15:56:48:23]
You know we made I think we made the leaven she and I did.

[15:56:54:17]
And so as he was preaching the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said he wanted to use me in that ministry there.

[15:57:03:02]
And of course I argued with the Lord because I thought I'm in Bateswood Mississippi we're in Arkansas and you know I just argued with him.

[15:57:12:00]
You know I thought well Lord if I follow your command You have to open three major doors for me.

[15:57:20:23]
You know what I'm doing over there at the church teaching this precious little Sunday school class to children I just love.

[15:57:28:00]
And it's amazing how God works.

[15:57:31:12]
If you know anything about the Lord when the Spirit tells you to do something He's already prepared the way.

[15:57:39:19]
He's opened the doors for you.

[15:57:41:00]
You just don't know it realize it.

[15:57:42:18]
So the door number one was the former pastor.

[15:57:47:00]
We had a pastor that my husband got you know when he got disabled a breach and he was in bad health.

[15:57:53:20]
He was a diabetic.

[15:57:55:20]
And so he passed away in that three years and we had his funeral.

[15:58:01:15]
So his wife had nerve problems and she didn't come very often you know.

[15:58:06:07]
If she got the right medication she would come to church.

[15:58:12:15]
And lo and behold one morning with the doorbell ringing I was sitting there you know having time with the Lord 'cause I'm also an administrator on our sites too on ministry sites and it was she it was Patsy.

[15:58:28:22]
And I was surprised because she had never visited when her husband visited you know my came to visit my husband.

[15:58:35:06]
So she had a brochure going to show me the headstone she had picked out for her husband.

[15:58:42:01]
I offered a coffee and so the Lord told me to ask.

[15:58:46:08]
I said "Patty how would you like to take over paying the bills at the church?"

[15:58:51:03]
And she thought a minute she said "Are you fixing to retire?"

[15:58:54:21]
I said "I haven't found a scripture yet for I can retire."

[15:58:58:05]
And she thought a minute she said "Well sure."

[15:59:01:06]
I said "Well I'll finish out this month and then I'll notify everyone that you're gonna be paying the bills.

[15:59:07:04]
Just give me your address you know and your phone number." which she did.

[15:59:11:15]
So that was door number one that was a major door.

[15:59:15:23]
And then door number two that got open for me one of the young girls at church one of her grandchildren was in my son's school class.

[15:59:26:11]
And I asked her name was Barbara.

[15:59:28:00]
I said "Barbara how would you like to take over "teaching my class?"

[15:59:31:13]
And she said "Oh I would love to Peggy."

[15:59:34:19]
And so that was door number two.

[15:59:36:14]
So door number three I stood before the church one Sunday before service.

[15:59:43:09]
And I told the church family that God had called me into another ministry and that they could get together and pray for a pianist and also they could pray for God to send a pastor to the church that I was leaving.

[16:00:01:05]
And it was sad but it was also following Jesus which I do.

[16:00:08:15]
So what was your first impression when you met Pastor Bob personally?

[16:00:16:15]
Oh he loved Jesus and he was anointed and that's all he preached.

[16:00:25:01]
And you just don't hear that at any churches today really.

[16:00:30:11]
How is the congregation how is the church family different from other churches you've involved with?

[16:00:38:09]
Well I grew up Southern Baptist but our church was Independent Baptist which you know doesn't have anything to do with the Association you know.

[16:00:48:06]
Same gospel but it's just independent you know and our missionaries get all the money instead of you know broken up as it is through the Association.

[16:01:00:02]
And your question was how was he different?

[16:01:05:12]
No how's the congregation how's the church family?

[16:01:08:17]
Is it any different than other churches you've been involved in?

[16:01:10:23]
Oh gosh yes.

[16:01:12:04]
Loving outgoing you know we've been told that our church is the most friendliest church and we make it that way because we welcome men you know and we take God with us the ones that have him in their heart and has given their heart and soul to him you know and we have a lot.

[16:01:35:10]
And we know that they're coming there when they come there if they come for different reasons you know people come from different reasons for church you know they get Jesus you know and we're told that you know we're one of the friendliest churches that they've ever been in and a lot of people that come you know that's not members that drive away you know a long way They wish they could be there all the time because they said even their own boats that go to church you know their churches are not like that today.

[16:02:12:14]
Is it disruptive at all on a Sunday to have so many outsiders coming to see for different reasons coming to see if the man's Elvis versus there from Jesus?

[16:02:25:14]
No.

[16:02:26:14]
If they come we don't know it.

[16:02:30:02]
Not at all.

[16:02:31:02]
Uh-huh.

[16:02:31:22]
And people are quite respectful there about whether they believe or not believe right?

[16:02:38:04]
Absolutely absolutely.

[16:02:40:08]
That's not what it's about.

[16:02:41:22]
Have you brought other people to the church?

[16:02:46:14]
Have I brought people?

[16:02:47:13]
Yeah.

[16:02:48:09]
My family has come 'cause they live in all different states.

[16:02:51:04]
My children you know they all flew in Mother's Day and surprised me and they really enjoyed it.

[16:02:57:18]
My oldest daughter's in mission work there in France she and her husband and they worked at Congo.

[16:03:08:16]
And so and my sister Bonnie she comes with me when she can.

[16:03:12:08]
Her son's a pastor at home you know and so she goes there too when she can support a pastor.

[16:03:19:08]
I mean her son which is normal you know.

[16:03:21:13]
What do you think of the theories around Bob Joyce?

[16:03:28:13]
What do you think of the theories around Bob?

[16:03:31:13]
What do you think of the Elvis-Bob Joyce comparisons?

[16:03:35:13]
I can tell you he's not Elvis because who he was before I ever knew him you know is the past.

[16:03:43:12]
It's like we all we die to ourselves when we become born again and give our heart and soul to Jesus Christ.

[16:03:50:12]
Jesus Christ so it doesn't matter.

[16:03:53:02]
I mean I don't know who he was.

[16:03:54:11]
I didn't know him.

[16:03:55:09]
You know so it doesn't matter because he's dedicated his soul and his life to Jesus whoever he was.

[16:04:05:11]
The old has passed away when we become born again.

[16:04:08:23]
You know just like our sins are as far as get forgiven as far as the East from the West.

[16:04:14:06]
You know so.

[16:04:16:08]
I love his family.

[16:04:19:04]
They're just precious all up in town.

[16:04:22:07]
It's the greatest Bible teacher.

[16:04:24:11]
He teaches on Wednesday nights.

[16:04:26:07]
Is that a common theme at this church?

[16:04:31:08]
That people if they follow the same story of whoever he was prior versus who he is now is there some beauty in that that everyone who attends that church gets to live by that same example?

[16:04:48:10]
and you drop who you do die to self when you show up at this church.

[16:04:54:00]
Well you don't know only God knows their minds and their hearts and what they're thinking.

[16:04:59:10]
But no matter what they come there for thinking if he is someone else in the past you know some famous person they leave there with Jesus.

[16:05:09:02]
They've heard the word of Jesus.

[16:05:10:11]
They know about Jesus.

[16:05:12:00]
That's the main thing.

[16:05:13:12]
It's a neat example for people to know that they can leave their past at the door also right?

[16:05:18:12]
Absolutely.

[16:05:20:10]
Yeah.

[16:05:21:06]
Yeah it's vertical.

[16:05:22:21]
Brian thoughts?

[16:05:25:03]
Yeah I'm gonna move that mic.

[16:05:26:08]
How can I see it?

[16:05:27:23]
Oh I can be.

[16:05:28:19]
Okay.

[16:05:29:16]
You should just tell me right off the bat.

[16:05:31:15]
All right.

[16:05:34:16]
You're fine.

[16:05:34:17]
I can cut it out but it's just easier not to have to do good thanks.

[16:05:39:05]
Hello.

[16:05:40:01]
Any questions left on your mic?

[16:05:42:22]
Peggy I mean again the elephant in the room always is the people compared Pastor Bob to Elvis.

[16:05:50:08]
I mean that's just the elephant no one talks about it.

[16:05:52:08]
And I know that you probably don't want to say too much on that but maybe talk about what it was like growing up.

[16:05:59:05]
You grew up in the time when Elvis was popular and was a singer.

[16:06:03:02]
He wasn't I wasn't a fan of Elvis.

[16:06:05:06]
You were?

[16:06:06:02]
No.

[16:06:06:22]
I was the only person in high school that could drive a car and I took a load to the first drive-in when he came out in Jailhouse Rock I think.

[16:06:20:02]
And I sat there in the car and they were crazy.

[16:06:22:01]
I thought they were gonna tear the speakers off the thing.

[16:06:25:06]
I said "Lord it must be something wrong with me because I couldn't stand it.

[16:06:29:23]
I'll be honest with you."

[16:06:31:06]
Where did you grow up?

[16:06:36:01]
I grew up in Batesville Mississippi.

[16:06:38:13]
I've lived in Dallas Jackson Memphis you know.

[16:06:42:11]
So I mean Elvis was a big deal around the world but certainly where you were there in Mississippi.

[16:06:49:12]
Right but I didn't know it.

[16:06:52:09]
I didn't know about him.

[16:06:53:14]
Did not know about him.

[16:06:56:10]
In fact I've told Pastor Bob Joyce I wasn't a fan of Elvis really.

[16:07:02:09]
How does Pastor Bob handle I don't want to say pressure but he's aware that people come to the church thinking he's out.

[16:07:11:07]
It's like how does he handle that?

[16:07:12:10]
Well it's like that you know he handles it himself well because he's so full of the spirit and he's so anointing.

[16:07:23:03]
He depends on Christ for everything.

[16:07:27:09]
By prayer we all pray for him and the whole entire family.

[16:07:36:08]
He handles himself well.

[16:07:43:08]
He doesn't think about it.

[16:07:46:08]
Do you guys feel protective of ...

[16:07:48:05]
Some ...

[16:07:49:08]
Becky pardon?

[16:07:50:04]
Do you feel protective of Pastor Bob?

[16:07:52:21]
Oh yes because of the work I've been in in my life.

[16:07:56:06]
Yeah there's attorney's office.

[16:07:59:11]
Baby how have you seen the church grow over these seven years?

[16:08:08:18]
How has it changed?

[16:08:09:18]
Ever since his sermon started been videoed and put on social media.

[16:08:18:14]
You know it began to grow.

[16:08:20:05]
Does the culture stay the same?

[16:08:23:02]
Does it feel the same over these seven years?

[16:08:25:18]
It's different you know because you know you start out with just a small group you know.

[16:08:35:06]
It's more it's different for the because it's you don't have quite the intimacy that you had with just a small group but it's the same really the people are the same.

[16:08:47:19]
The ones that love Pastor Bob and protect him and pray for the whole family they're just such a blessing in today's time.

[16:09:00:04]
You just wouldn't believe there's so many we're in the last days.

[16:09:05:15]
Guys I just want you to know that the main thing is to be ready. according to Bible prophecy and we're in World War III already and the time is now.

[16:09:17:20]
It's now.

[16:09:20:02]
And so it's good though that these people are coming.

[16:09:26:02]
You know a lot of them sure don't even go to church.

[16:09:29:13]
I'm sure a lot don't have the Lord.

[16:09:32:02]
And that's what we're praying for.

[16:09:33:10]
Our main interest now is for lost souls because we don't want anybody to go to hell you know.

[16:09:39:11]
And God is really angry now with America because America has not repented you know it's not going to repent.

[16:09:46:18]
And there's not going to be man saving the world especially the next election.

[16:09:55:19]
This won't be a ...

[16:09:57:02]
It's not going to be an election.

[16:09:59:13]
You can take that to bank.

[16:10:02:13]
Tell me the work you do or used to do.

[16:10:07:14]
I raised five children of my own my Lord.

[16:10:13:22]
Help me.

[16:10:15:11]
He was with me all the time.

[16:10:16:22]
I wasn't as close to him as I am now because it's my everything but I had the best jobs.

[16:10:25:17]
I didn't have to look for a job.

[16:10:27:15]
You know I worked my way ...

[16:10:31:03]
I didn't have college.

[16:10:32:08]
I took some college courses you know when I retired from the university.

[16:10:35:23]
Ole Miss.

[16:10:38:18]
I left the U.S. Attorney's Office.

[16:10:40:09]
I mean the Lord I think he dealt with me of leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office.

[16:10:45:10]
I could retire for $187000 a year.

[16:10:47:17]
Let's see money's not everything.

[16:10:50:04]
My daughter's in Michigan.

[16:10:51:11]
She had her doctorate in pharmacy and she retired from Costco as manager and so they built an U.N. in Birmingham and they offered her the manager's job there.

[16:11:05:22]
And after she had retired because she's always loved missions you know she's been to Indonesia just all over you know and her husband too.

[16:11:16:19]
And so they called her and asked her so she prayed about it and she said the Lord told her not to take it you know.

[16:11:24:18]
And she said it was tempting Mom but she said you know I'm following the Lord what God's got me doing you know which I love.

[16:11:32:18]
So they called her back the district manager they said "Well if you're willing need a break and want to come in and do a shift or two just call me."

[16:11:44:12]
That's how much they loved her and how good she was with people and with the job.

[16:11:51:06]
Well you had said though you worked like when I asked you about concern for safety is there worries from what you've seen and like father could be injured?

[16:12:05:05]
Not it's just it's just it's working where I worked you know and I held data hearings you know in collections you know I was collections for Northern District civil and criminal.

[16:12:21:21]
And sometimes I'd have to get the US Marshal in because it was a one-on-one you know I could I have discernment for character you know And I felt that if I had the need for the marshal to come in and sit in with me he would.

[16:12:40:20]
It's just that I can discern people.

[16:12:47:08]
And so if you feel like there's you know you can feel good spirit and bad spirit you know I'm sure you're one of both of you.

[16:12:57:17]
So it's just that you know you don't know in the days that we're in now is what I'm thinking about.

[16:13:03:18]
There's so much evil you know.

[16:13:05:18]
Satan you know is trying to get rid of everything God created even the people you know.

[16:13:14:15]
And if I see anything wrong you know I would sense it I would know it.

[16:13:21:06]
You know that was what I meant by that.

[16:13:24:06]
Because you never know because they're getting rid of you know Christians and pastors burning churches you know.

[16:13:33:18]
I think we made 11 Bonnie and I. I think we made 11 people.

[16:13:48:17]
We average sometimes 150 when we you know on special occasions I guess now the school started back.

[16:13:57:03]
But we have a lot of older people that come you know older.

[16:14:01:07]
I don't know if they're old as I am.

[16:14:04:18]
Probably some of them are.

[16:14:09:14]
And then some young people.

[16:14:11:10]
And we and God's you just wouldn't be surprised you'd be surprised.

[16:14:16:15]
It's amazing people.

[16:14:17:15]
I thank God I told Bob that I call him Bob.

[16:14:22:03]
He calls me mom.

[16:14:23:08]
I said "You know what that means if you call me mom?"

[16:14:27:10]
And he said "What?"

[16:14:28:06]
And I said "You do as I tell you."

[16:14:29:22]
But anyway it's good that there are people that come and God is sending those people there.

[16:14:38:17]
For what reasons like you say if they teach somebody else it doesn't matter because they're gonna hear about Jesus and some of them probably never have.

[16:14:49:00]
They're gonna leave there knowing that they need Jesus.

[16:14:55:00]
They need to repent.

[16:14:59:08]
That's interesting.

[16:15:01:09]
So the first timers have never been  Right exactly.

[16:15:06:15]
Exactly.

[16:15:07:15]
In other words they can't stand before Christ at the judgment and say "We never heard you.

[16:15:14:23]
"We didn't go to church."

[16:15:16:13]
They can't say that you know.

[16:15:18:08]
When he says "Depart from me I never knew you."

[16:15:22:12]
Didn't you?

[16:15:23:15]
That's heartbreaking to think of those thoughts.

[16:15:26:01]
'Cause you don't want anybody to hear those thoughts.

[16:15:31:06]
But then too there's so much evil now.

[16:15:33:17]
Our biggest problem is deception.

[16:15:36:07]
Deception is greater than tribulation.

[16:15:39:16]
And that's a bad thought.

[16:15:43:09]
It's so many people being deceived now.

[16:15:45:15]
Q. Could you could anyone ever draw a line to say that the Elvis scenario is deceiving people to get there?

[16:16:01:22]
A. No.

[16:16:02:22]
No for the simple reason you know when you're born again God says your old life is passed away.

[16:16:09:01]
You become you.

[16:16:11:09]
So you know people are going to think "What whatever they want to think.

[16:16:17:01]
Right exactly.

[16:16:22:01]
True.

[16:16:23:01]
Thank you. (laughs)  No.

[16:16:47:17]
Never met him?

[16:16:48:12]
No he's gosh.

[16:16:50:02]
I'm younger than he is.

[16:16:52:09]
I'm 84 he would have been well I don't know how old he would be.

[16:16:55:18]
Oh yeah I'm a pastor.

[16:17:02:05]
He's not 89 that's for real.

[16:17:04:17]
Oh my goodness.

[16:17:06:17]
You know that we've done I think I told you we've done probably 20 of these interviews.

[16:17:14:17]
A lot of the people I would say maybe 95% of the people do believe Pastor Augusto is homeless.

[16:17:23:17]
How do you respond to that?

[16:17:26:17]
Do you have a response?

[16:17:29:17]
No I've never even thought about it.

[16:17:31:17]
I'll be honest with you.

[16:17:32:17]
Yeah. because I'm not there for that you know God brought me there.

[16:17:37:01]
Yeah.

[16:17:38:02]
Is this a present to you that people think that?

[16:17:40:08]
People...

[16:17:42:23]
And not really because people are going to think what they want to think and see this talk about deception this social media you know people are using that man.

[16:18:00:15]
They're using him.

[16:18:02:02]
They're making money off of him.

[16:18:03:08]
And that's not good.

[16:18:07:00]
But you're gonna have it.

[16:18:08:01]
Absolutely.

[16:18:15:00]
Oh yes.

[16:18:17:00]
Did all the others think that it was?

[16:18:25:00]
Oh it's varied.

[16:18:27:02]
Honestly I think the greatest story that's come out of our interviews so far is that ultimately no one cares.

[16:18:33:00]
Right.

[16:18:35:00]
They show up they fall in love with Bob.

[16:18:37:00]
Absolutely.

[16:18:38:00]
Yeah that's it.

[16:18:39:00]
That's the reason I don't...

[16:18:39:00]
They're very very transformed.

[16:18:41:00]
And however they found their way there is...

[16:18:43:00]
Oh absolutely.

[16:18:45:00]
Yes.

[16:18:45:00]
I think that God uses even someone's quest to find Elvis God uses that to bring them into the community into the family and they find Christ.

[16:18:56:15]
Oh yeah.

[16:18:57:11]
Isn't that wonderful?

[16:18:59:13]
That's great that's great.

[16:19:00:23]
That's what it's all about.

[16:19:02:07]
It's two different things.

[16:19:03:17]
Bob has said in his sermons right don't look for Elvis look for Jesus.

[16:19:08:09]
Exactly he said at a convention in Hot Springs last weekend you know which was good.

[16:19:14:13]
And he's right just like politics people are people that you know they're Christians they're Christians but they're depending on Trump to turn things around.

[16:19:27:05]
Nothing's going to be turned around.

[16:19:28:21]
God is ready to pour out his judgment.

[16:19:31:16]
He is now.

[16:19:33:03]
He uses the devil you know all this this Kim I mean they're destroying our atmosphere everything and chemtrails.

[16:19:45:07]
I flew a couple of weeks ago to my sons in Florida.

[16:19:48:22]
Had been up in the skies.

[16:19:50:11]
I flew a lot when I worked for the US Attorney's Office with you know a person from each state 50 states you know we would have meetings you know we flew a lot.

[16:20:01:09]
And this helicopter pilot sat down by me.

[16:20:06:06]
I flew from Memphis to Atlanta you know back to Tampa.

[16:20:09:13]
And he was retired you know and he flew in the military.

[16:20:15:06]
And I was looking out the window and I said "The skies don't look like they did up here 20 years ago."

[16:20:23:15]
He said "No they sure don't.

[16:20:26:16]
I could tell you a lot."

[16:20:28:01]
You know so it's really sad but it's going to be exciting our new world.
