[16:36:19:21]
I think so.

[16:36:22:21]
Alright settle.

[16:36:25:21]
Rose tell us your name again where you live and how long you've been coming to the church.

[16:36:31:21]
What's your name and what's your church?

[16:36:33:07]
Rose McKean Charleston West Virginia.

[16:36:36:00]
I have never been to the church yet but I listen online and I've been listening for a little over four years.

[16:36:41:17]
Okay sorry do that again 'cause we were pointing all at something.

[16:36:43:21]
You either talk to me or talk to your either way.

[16:36:45:18]
Oh okay talk into that?

[16:36:47:01]
Sure feel comfortable with it.

[16:36:48:07]
Or you?

[16:36:49:03]
Yes.

[16:36:49:23]
Okay.

[16:36:50:19]
Rose McKean Charleston West Virginia and I have never been to the church but I've been listening online for a little over four years now.

[16:36:59:15]
So this is your first weekend here?

[16:37:00:22]
Yes I've tried three times to get here and things came up and canceled airline tickets.

[16:37:05:12]
And this is the third time's a charm.

[16:37:06:21]
I'm going to be here this Sunday.

[16:37:08:08]
How did you first hear about the church?

[16:37:10:22]
I found out about the church online.

[16:37:13:16]
I've been an Elvis fan since I was a teeny-bopper.

[16:37:17:11]
And I'm always searching for Elvis music to listen to and videos and so on.

[16:37:23:18]
And then one day this picture popped up and it had a picture of Pastor Bob Joyce and this lady named Laura.

[16:37:33:09]
And she had been to the church and had her picture made with him and said "100% this is Elvis Presley."

[16:37:40:22]
And I was aghast and so was everybody else that looked at it.

[16:37:45:07]
And I guess it probably were church members and they were saying "Oh you know you can't say this and all that."

[16:37:50:21]
So I inboxed her.

[16:37:51:21]
I messaged her.

[16:37:53:05]
And I said "Laura I don't know you but I think maybe you might have an issue here that you need to take that down."

[16:37:59:03]
And I said "I'll message you back and tell you what I think and we'll talk about it."

[16:38:04:13]
So she did and she messaged me back and she said "I got it down."

[16:38:08:17]
And I said "Well if in fact this Pastor Bob is Elvis then there must be a reason why we don't know that for sure."

[16:38:18:01]
I said "He may be hiding something."

[16:38:20:12]
So she agreed and she said "Well you just need to come down here to the church and see for yourself."

[16:38:26:09]
She said "I've been an Elvis fan."

[16:38:28:01]
She said "I was not even born when he existed but I grew up my grandmother taught me everything about him and I had Elvis wedding and then she's going on and on."

[16:38:36:16]
I said "That's great."

[16:38:37:16]
I said "I've been a fan too."

[16:38:38:16]
I said "But you know I think really you need to keep it quiet you know just to be careful."

[16:38:46:00]
And so she said "Okay."

[16:38:47:15]
We became friends online and I kept watching Pastor Bob.

[16:38:51:10]
I had been looking for a church because the COVID shut our church down.

[16:38:56:18]
And I searched for online.

[16:38:59:12]
And I had been at one kind of church all my life from Catholic to Pentecostal to Baptist.

[16:39:06:10]
And I still was searching for the truth online.

[16:39:10:06]
And I said you know in between this time I've got to find somebody that speaks the truth. listening to Pastor Bob because she had mentioned how good he was.

[16:39:19:05]
So I got excited and I started listening and I was amazed.

[16:39:23:14]
I mean it was so simple.

[16:39:25:07]
Everything was just he had he told analogies and he made it like like you could just imagine everything going on with what he was saying about the Bible.

[16:39:34:00]
And I said I have never heard it preach like this.

[16:39:37:01]
And honestly I could feel the spirit the hairs on my arm would go up when he'd speak And I'd get cold chills and I thought you know I've never felt this before.

[16:39:46:15]
I knew there was something special.

[16:39:49:06]
And so I would back and forth with her and she'd say I just come back from church up there.

[16:39:53:11]
You've got to go.

[16:39:54:11]
The people are wonderful.

[16:39:55:11]
And I said I don't need to go to the church.

[16:39:58:21]
I live a long way off.

[16:39:59:21]
And I said it's great you're going.

[16:40:01:21]
She said well I'm in Key West.

[16:40:02:21]
I fly up there.

[16:40:03:21]
I said oh you're kidding me.

[16:40:04:21]
I didn't realize where she was from.

[16:40:07:15]
She said but you've got to go.

[16:40:09:07]
I'll meet you up there and we'll go together.

[16:40:11:01]
I said "No I'm very happy with listening online.

[16:40:14:19]
I'm getting so much out of it and I can go back and listen again."

[16:40:17:21]
So you know we just became good friends.

[16:40:20:03]
And then I decided well Ties and All Friends I'm just gonna send them to Household of Faith right?

[16:40:25:21]
'Cause I'm a part of that church and I just loved everything he was saying.

[16:40:31:04]
And then so that was probably for a year at least.

[16:40:35:10]
And lo and behold I got a letter in the mail from uh... willing to joys pastor bob's wife and she and uh... she mentions they were going to do a fundraising video not a video i'm sorry a cd uh... cd with some christmas carols on it to do a fundraiser for the church would i be interested in maybe pre-ordering some cds or some t-shirts or something i can't remember exactly i know that cds were on there and i said yes of course i would i said i'll just give them for christmas presents she says well they're not gonna come out until about couple weeks before Christmas and this was like in September and I said well that's fine it's okay and so I did that because you know I'd heard he's singing and he's singing was really good and I saw similarities you know in what he was singing and then he'd give his little hints when he preached he'd say things like I gave everything up I had wealth I had a dining room table with bags of money on it.

[16:41:33:19]
I had people lining up at my house to see where I lived and I had these big cars but I gave it all up for Jesus and I said "I've heard that story before."

[16:41:42:12]
Because I did a lot of research right?

[16:41:46:01]
So I ordered some CDs and then a little bit later I got another letter saying "Would you be interested in coming to the recording studio and being a part of the recording and I could not believe it.

[16:42:01:10]
I said "Lord thank you."

[16:42:03:05]
I said "This is great.

[16:42:04:10]
I'll get to see Pastor Bob."

[16:42:06:05]
And Wilena was so sweet.

[16:42:08:00]
She was great.

[16:42:08:19]
I even talked to her on the phone and she was a great person.

[16:42:11:22]
And so I went and it was here in Bentonville you know not far from I don't even know the distance.

[16:42:22:12]
I think it's a few hours drive to Bentonville.

[16:42:25:14]
But anyway I flew into there.

[16:42:28:14]
And it was funny when I walked into the recording studio.

[16:42:33:02]
Everybody stood up and willing said hello Rose.

[16:42:36:04]
I said how'd you know it was me?

[16:42:37:09]
She said 'cause you're the only person we haven't ever seen.

[16:42:40:16]
And so it was just wonderful from then on out.

[16:42:42:16]
I was in the studio.

[16:42:44:04]
They had it so that the six couples that they invited to come they had it spread out that when you would go in there two people at a time would be right in there when he was tweaking everything and it was amazing.

[16:42:58:02]
And I'll tell you what when I heard him do the adjustments and heard him singing I mean there was no doubt.

[16:43:06:06]
I mean it was just magnificent.

[16:43:08:10]
He hit the high notes that nobody could hit except Elvis.

[16:43:11:23]
I mean that was my opinion.

[16:43:13:10]
And I said it's either that or he's a clone.

[16:43:15:04]
It's gotta be one or two.

[16:43:16:04]
I mean you know and everybody was so nice.

[16:43:19:01]
They became good friends and it was just an experience I felt like I was really blessed to be a part of that.

[16:43:29:01]
And I feel like Pastor Bob has been anointed.

[16:43:32:06]
I feel like his past will draw people in.

[16:43:38:16]
But that was the image and Pastor Bob Joyce is the man.

[16:43:42:09]
And I thought I loved Elvis Presley and I did but I love Pastor Bob Moore because he preaches the truth and we all need to hear that.

[16:43:52:21]
Tell me about the album.

[16:43:55:17]
It's a Christmas one it's wonderful.

[16:43:57:12]
He has a traditional Christmas songs on it.

[16:43:59:16]
The last song is the Lord's Prayer he sings that and I literally tears streaming down my eyes the whole time I'm in there but they've sold a good bit of it. done really well and I really like it.

[16:44:14:15]
I bought my little granddaughter who is going to be nine years old next week.

[16:44:19:19]
I bought her a CD player and because I raised her on Elvis Presley of course right and so I got her a CD player and got her one of the albums and she knows every single song.

[16:44:29:23]
She listens to it 12 months out of the year it's Christmas at their house you know.

[16:44:35:01]
I asked my daughter I I said "Is Ava still listening to the CD?"

[16:44:40:06]
She said "24/7." (laughing)  Amazing amazing.

[16:44:46:04]
Rose may I ask you how old you are?

[16:44:48:03]
I will be 80 next year my birthday.

[16:44:50:16]
So you know that I was right in the right zone there to be a fan.

[16:44:56:05]
I mean I even went to a concert.

[16:44:58:13]
So yeah.

[16:45:00:03]
That's fantastic.

[16:45:00:03]
But also for as young and vibrant and healthy you are People struggle with the idea that if Bob was Elvis he would be 89 years old.

[16:45:14:03]
I struggle with you telling me that you're about to be 80 years old.

[16:45:18:03]
I'll show you my driver's license.

[16:45:20:03]
You could have lied there too.

[16:45:22:03]
Yeah well I think he probably takes care of himself.

[16:45:29:02]
I know I've eaten lunch with him and so on.

[16:45:31:02]
I know he eats really healthy and of course he has plenty of things probably in addition to that.

[16:45:39:02]
I know he's active.

[16:45:42:02]
I watched him help work on the church yesterday.

[16:45:46:02]
He was out there at the bus stall.

[16:45:47:02]
Does he seem 89 years old to you?

[16:45:50:02]
I mean like could even have a super healthy version of one.

[16:45:53:06]
Do you think he's 89 years old?

[16:45:55:02]
I think he'd be over 90 even from what I saw him do with my own eyes yesterday.

[16:46:01:17]
I'm telling you I was amazed.

[16:46:02:17]
And I was getting worried.

[16:46:03:17]
I said "Should he be doing all this work?

[16:46:06:13]
It's hot or not?

[16:46:07:13]
I don't know what.

[16:46:08:13]
We're in a barn area that's no air conditioning.

[16:46:13:12]
Fans were going."

[16:46:14:12]
But I mean nonstop that morning until like noon-ish sawing and pounding and working never took a break.

[16:46:23:03]
I mean so you know I'm amazed at how he can do that but yet I've seen him in person and he fits the age that he's supposed to be.

[16:46:31:12]
I mean you know.

[16:46:32:09]
He does.

[16:46:33:04]
He does I think so yeah.

[16:46:34:03]
And I think you'll see some pictures that'll show that too and I think if you see him in person you'll see that.

[16:46:39:09]
Yeah.

[16:46:40:05]
Yeah.

[16:46:40:18]
Anything in particular that hurts people say the hands?

[16:46:43:16]
Yeah well the hand thing made me realize that he was not really dead that he was still alive because in the casket one of the relatives and this came out online or maybe even where it was written in a newspaper I don't not remember but they said he's not in there I looked at his hands and I know that he has cuts and scars from everything that he's done and that whatever's in that casket didn't have any of that.

[16:47:15:07]
And then I had read sightings anyway too.

[16:47:17:21]
I mean people that are Elvis fans they didn't give up looking for him.

[16:47:21:08]
They didn't want him to be dead okay?

[16:47:23:12]
And so and he still has what he should have on his hands just put it that way you know?

[16:47:31:07]
He didn't have that smooth thing like it was in the casket.

[16:47:33:23]
Talk about the community around Bob.

[16:47:41:18]
Everybody that I have met.

[16:47:43:03]
I met we had an after party after we completed the CD and I just I said "These people are wonderful."

[16:47:49:13]
I mean it seems like you've known them all your life when you just meet them for 10 minutes and you just talk openly and I don't know I just loved it.

[16:47:57:23]
And I'm very excited about Sunday morning.

[16:48:02:00]
I am I really am 'cause so many people said and Laura I didn't tell Laura I was gonna be down here this week but 'cause it was spur of the moment thing and she's been wanting to bring me back and be there when I come for the first time but everybody says oh you've got to go you don't understand you don't understand. and I do believe that.

[16:48:23:20]
So where are you at in the probability of 0 to 100% that Pastor Bob could possibly be on his breast?

[16:48:31:17]
Well first of all I was a little bit worried about talking about this okay because I didn't want to do anything that might so-called out him you know but when you listen to his sermons he gives you clues that tie in that you can figure out if you want to figure it out.

[16:48:48:01]
But like I said I don't think the name means anything because Elvis was an image that we fell in love with.

[16:48:54:17]
We had no personal relationship with him other than through the music right?

[16:48:59:09]
But it's different with Pastor Bob.

[16:49:01:07]
He's the man.

[16:49:02:11]
He has in his heart goodness love and one nugget I took from one Sunday was pray from victory not for victory because we are already God's children and we know that He knows what we need before we ask for it.

[16:49:26:12]
And that made me I got chills now when I think about that because it changed my whole attitude about prayer it really did and about who I am with Jesus. that you were such a big Elvis fan growing up why do you think that Elvis would have possibly faked his death?

[16:49:45:16]
Well from what I knew from following everything that he did I don't know how he could have lasted long in that lifestyle I'll be honest with you.

[16:49:56:16]
No matter how physically fit you are which I read that he did all of the martial arts and all of that and was very serious about.

[16:50:02:16]
In fact I went to Graceland twice in my lifetime and the tour guide said that his waist circumference never varied from you know it was a thirty-something or whatever I don't know what it was but he always stayed fit.

[16:50:16:05]
And so you know you can't keep doing that life he had.

[16:50:21:21]
He just couldn't do it I don't think.

[16:50:25:06]
And you read about how when he wanted to go to the movies he'd have to rent the whole movie theater.

[16:50:29:17]
And he loved the people though.

[16:50:31:22]
I mean that's the thing about he loved the people and he wanted to be with them but he couldn't have a life that everybody else had.

[16:50:37:14]
He probably was happiest maybe when he didn't have all of that fame and glory and maybe he wanted it back.

[16:50:44:14]
I mean most people would wouldn't you think?

[16:50:56:16]
Well I just love the whole idea of household to faith.

[16:50:59:15]
I'm glad I'm a part of it and I want to do as much as I can to help out and I thank Pastor Bob and the whole family at Household of Faith for making me a part of all that too.

[16:51:09:18]
I feel very honored and privileged and blessed by God to be a part of that I really do.

[16:51:15:10]
Thank you.

[16:51:17:10]
Thank you. (claps)
