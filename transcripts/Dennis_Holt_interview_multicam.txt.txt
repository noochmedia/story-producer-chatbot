[17:13:54:00]
Make me remember whatever these gentlemen want to know.

[17:13:56:23]
Let me get a quick sip.

[17:14:00:23]
Pure life.

[17:14:09:23]
It'll quench your thirst.

[17:14:10:23]
I'm going to make you out that's all we needed.

[17:14:13:23]
Now we've got the movie paid for.

[17:14:16:23]
Actually that could wait.

[17:14:18:23]
Oh.

[17:14:19:23]
Perfect thank you.

[17:14:21:23]
Alright you can answer directly to me.

[17:14:26:23]
Okay.

[17:14:27:23]
Tell me your name and what do you do for a living?

[17:14:30:23]
My name is Dennis Holt and I am a professional drummer-percussionist.

[17:14:34:23]
Tell me some of the fun stuff you've done throughout your career.

[17:14:37:22]
Well it's been a long career.

[17:14:41:11]
I got my first drum kit at nine and I'm 71 and I'm still full time.

[17:14:48:22]
Wow I don't want to him and ha but...

[17:14:52:22]
What are a couple of the big ticket ones that people like to hear about?

[17:14:56:22]
I did a run with the Kansas Boys.

[17:14:59:22]
That was loads of fun.

[17:15:01:23]
A lot of fun.

[17:15:02:22]
The music was fabulous.

[17:15:04:22]
There's another guy that does worship music.

[17:15:09:12]
He ran a worship label for a number of years called Integrity.

[17:15:13:19]
Don Moen.

[17:15:15:09]
They called and said "We understand you love doing classes clinics like a master class or whatever music stores or churches."

[17:15:24:12]
And he said "We're going to tour the world and play worship music and we will do a worship clinic either the day after or the day before.

[17:15:31:23]
Are you interested?"

[17:15:32:23]
And I went "Yes sir.

[17:15:33:23]
And I got to go places I would have never gone.

[17:15:36:23]
Vietnam India India three times Abu Dhabi and Dubai and got to play in front of kings and princes that wanted to come hear this American worship music.

[17:15:53:23]
It was amazing.

[17:15:55:22]
And I'm so thankful that I had those opportunities.

[17:15:58:22]
And again like I said this I still Joni has asked me if my gal she's asked me you know things will come up about songs.

[17:16:09:22]
Do you remember playing on that song?

[17:16:10:22]
And a lot of sessions you know when you're doing so many you forget them.

[17:16:14:22]
And since we're doing this interview and somebody mentioned it last night I remember the tracking stuff for Taylor Swift.

[17:16:23:22]
On her first record she was 15.

[17:16:25:22]
15.

[17:16:27:04]
And I remember those songs and then we all forgot.

[17:16:30:15]
We had no idea that it was going to...we just thought it was another teenager doing a record.

[17:16:35:16]
The date was fun and then a year or so later all of a sudden there's this new artist and it's like "What?"

[17:16:45:13]
Memories like that are fun.

[17:16:47:17]
And then the day to day sometimes you just sort of forget because There were times when I've cut with publishing things in masters which a master would be somebody's record 30 songs a week.

[17:17:02:17]
But you kind of get burned out on that because there's no time to create.

[17:17:07:11]
Doing records and creating is the most fun.

[17:17:09:06]
Tell me about the power of worship music.

[17:17:19:08]
It's different now.

[17:17:21:08]
Music is different but worship is still worship.

[17:17:24:08]
But what I see and where I think about the power of worship is a lot of people think we have control over what people are doing.

[17:17:34:08]
We don't.

[17:17:36:08]
Responsibility when I'm on the platform and I'm playing is to usher people into the presence of the Lord. not to be a jazzercise instructor or any of all that stuff.

[17:17:52:08]
A lot of I've seen a lot of you know worship settings became rock concerts with fog and lights and and you know I understand competing with the world but I remember the days of being in a room with 200 people or 10000 no special lights no special fog and just playing a song tears running down my cheeks and knowing that the moment was that it was a moment and the anointing was there and we're just singing.

[17:18:27:08]
It was one of those things where you walk out on the platform you could tell how people are acting like it's a show and I remember a worship leader that I had a lot of respect for said "Ladies and gentlemen you can join us in worship and participate or you can just observe.

[17:18:43:20]
I would really like to see you participate because we're just going to worship up here and you can do whatever you want."

[17:18:51:05]
And I thought "Wow."

[17:18:52:18]
And for me from behind the kit there are times when I'm bawling my eyes out and I've seen lives change.

[17:18:59:11]
People come forward or even if they don't just the joy of the room is hard to compare to anything else.

[17:19:06:13]
So how'd you find your way to this project?

[17:19:10:11]
Yeah well the producer's name is John Hartley.

[17:19:13:17]
You've probably heard that name and maybe even interviewed him.

[17:19:17:09]
And although he doesn't like that stuff very much he's English and very shy and demure.

[17:19:22:19]
John and I met years ago touring.

[17:19:26:14]
My first trip to Europe in the early '80s I was living in L.A flew over with a band.

[17:19:33:07]
We started in Amsterdam went all over all over Scandinavia Europe.

[17:19:38:09]
And we have these two guys called Phil and John opening up for us.

[17:19:43:21]
And Phil Bagley and John Hartley.

[17:19:46:13]
Phil and I became fast friends.

[17:19:49:06]
I fly back home.

[17:19:50:10]
Then I go out on a tour with a wonderful Christian artist guitar player by the name of Phil Keagy.

[17:19:55:22]
We're out.

[17:19:56:18]
Phil and John are opening for us.

[17:19:59:14]
Then I fly back over to Europe with Steve Taylor and Phil and John.

[17:20:05:05]
So all that kept happening.

[17:20:07:15]
And I've been back in Nashville 22 years.

[17:20:12:08]
John moved back probably 20 John moved here from England 24 years ago or something like that.

[17:20:17:23]
We started doing a lot of records together worship.

[17:20:20:23]
And I was flying over to do worship conferences with him in England every year.

[17:20:26:03]
And so maybe a couple months ago I can't put a date on it now.

[17:20:34:09]
John calls me up and he goes Hey are you available?

[17:20:38:22]
For like I only need you for one session could be two at Dark Horse.

[17:20:43:07]
We're going to go in and do a kind of three or four songs for an artist.

[17:20:49:11]
That's a pastor in Arkansas and he's believed to be Elvis.

[17:20:55:22]
And I went.

[17:20:57:16]
OK I thought he was joking.

[17:21:01:17]
And he goes "No I'm serious."

[17:21:04:11]
And I went "Okay."

[17:21:06:19]
So John booked me we'd all meet there and I got to meet Bob and a bunch of his friends his lovely wife and thinking about his age he started singing and I went "Okay I don't know about the story but wow "he's got that tone and that oh look that thing "that big box thing."

[17:21:29:21]
And we had a great time.

[17:21:31:18]
And it was wonderful.

[17:21:34:17]
I left and John said "Vin it's kind of a normal day."

[17:21:39:17]
Then John called later and said "I need you for four days.

[17:21:43:17]
We're gonna go to Insight and we're gonna do a record for this gentleman."

[17:21:47:10]
And I went "The Elvis guy."

[17:21:49:14]
And he goes and I have to ask 'cause like I said one day to the next I'm working on different artists.

[17:21:54:21]
So he said "Yeah."

[17:21:58:14]
And I went "Okay."

[17:22:01:09]
And then I saw the song list and I went "Wow this is gonna be fun."

[17:22:06:17]
And Bob brought his family of people all wonderful wonderful people.

[17:22:15:12]
And I mean I never if I thought about a cup of coffee somebody was handing it to me.

[17:22:21:16]
If I wanted a snack all I had to do was "Hey Dwayne can I have a Somebody's out going "What can we get you?"

[17:22:29:15]
They were so incredible.

[17:22:32:22]
And every day I felt like Bob got more comfortable with what we were doing.

[17:22:40:07]
And 'cause sometimes hanging out with session guys we have a language.

[17:22:45:20]
And players were all wonderful we've all been friends we've played records for years together.

[17:22:51:16]
And again like the producer and I go back to at least 84 or five.

[17:22:59:18]
And he was one of the first that held my baby who is now 35 years old my youngest son.

[17:23:06:03]
And the recording experience well one world class studio having Danny Duncan get drum sounds and having Dwayne Engineer and I gotta tell you the experience it was really wonderful.

[17:23:21:20]
And I thought boy there's some things going on here that I have no control over.

[17:23:26:03]
And so when I walk into a room whether it's church or a session like what I did with Bob and there's always we'll have a prayer and I'll sit down at the drum kit and before I ever start just kind of try to hope that I'm by myself or something in the room and I'll just Lord.

[17:23:42:11]
This kind of hits at a weird time doesn't it?

[17:23:50:04]
(laughs) "Lord I'm a little tired today.

[17:23:54:06]
I don't have anything to offer.

[17:23:55:23]
Please play through me."

[17:23:59:08]
And he shows up.

[17:24:04:19]
I count off and we play.

[17:24:06:04]
And I got to hear these songs the first time today driving down here from lunch after church.

[17:24:15:12]
And I just thought wow this really turned out well.

[17:24:21:05]
Bob sounds fabulous.

[17:24:23:04]
And I'm just I couldn't tell you how excited I am about whatever this is gonna be.

[17:24:28:09]
At least for me at this point it's I played on a record with some fun people with a really really interesting talented I think 86 year old man is he 86 84?

[17:24:42:08]
A lot of debate out there.

[17:24:43:04]
I mean you don't see a lot of that.

[17:24:44:22]
You don't see a lot of guys in the studio singing the way he does.

[17:24:48:21]
So it's been pretty wonderful.

[17:24:51:04]
Did he seem familiar with the studio experience or was it all pretty did it seem overwhelming?

[17:24:56:19]
Like what was your read on him?

[17:24:58:18]
The studio experience didn't seem overwhelming although some of the studios we're in they're overwhelming to even people like me if you've not been in a place like Insight.

[17:25:08:16]
Or even at Dark Horse you pull up and it looks like a ski lodge in Vale.

[17:25:13:21]
And I don't know if you guys ever made it out there But it's an unbelievable place.

[17:25:21:01]
So it can be a little daunting when you walk in going wait a minute there's Studio A there's Studio what?

[17:25:27:23]
And then you walk into the room we're in and the control room is massive.

[17:25:34:00]
They designed it to be big where everything sounds really tight.

[17:25:38:20]
And I'm in a separate room.

[17:25:41:14]
We put him in a piano room to work on stuff.

[17:25:44:09]
And I think what probably seemed a little uncomfortable was just being around people he didn't know in a setting of "Okay wow."

[17:25:57:08]
But he was comfortable with the process.

[17:26:04:02]
And what we did is we went out of our way we knew that we just needed to take some time.

[17:26:09:23]
And because he was sort of working out arrangements in his head he'd play a thing and then it's "Well I really want two more bars whatever."

[17:26:15:16]
So we just all slowed down 'cause often it's kinda like "Hurry hurry hurry hurry."

[17:26:20:05]
And often if I don't get first or second take I may not get called back.

[17:26:25:07]
This was a real project of let's take time and create.

[17:26:29:15]
Let's work on tempos.

[17:26:30:18]
And Bob Bob was helpful and he it didn't seem foreign it just seemed a little bit overwhelming because of I don't know these guys that are gonna play my music.

[17:26:42:05]
And then again like I said some of these studios can be like "Whew whoa."

[17:26:47:02]
You look at the console and it's 40 feet long.

[17:26:51:15]
But he seemed at home regarding telling us what he wanted.

[17:26:55:03]
So I could tell that he has done music and recorded before.

[17:27:00:12]
So that didn't seem odd at all.

[17:27:04:18]
Was there any point during the recording that you would let your mind go to a place that you might be playing with Elvis?

[17:27:11:18]
Um I wanted to play with that idea.

[17:27:14:18]
Again it's a crazy thought.

[17:27:24:17]
And Ronnie Tut was a dear friend of mine who played with Elvis from Fontana when that band went away and then Ronnie was the guy.

[17:27:34:18]
All the Vegas all those modern hits when I was still a kid even though I'm 71.

[17:27:43:05]
I was a kid when a lot of that stuff came out.

[17:27:47:06]
And Ronnie has passed on so it was not like I could call Ronnie and go "Ronnie do Do you think?

[17:27:54:19]
But there were times when I would be in the moment of the song and hearing this voice thinking "Well this could be an 86 80-something-year-old..."

[17:28:08:18]
Because I mean let's face it.

[17:28:11:05]
I won't drop a name on the amazing star that's in his 80s that told me one day years ago he goes "You take care of this instrument and it will last a lifetime."

[17:28:22:18]
And so I'm thinking "Wow this man's 80-something and he's still got this great voice."

[17:28:28:16]
And could it be Elvis?

[17:28:32:16]
I mean maybe.

[17:28:36:06]
I was like hey if it is I can put him on my resume.

[17:28:41:20]
But I'll put Bob Joyce on there because I got a feeling there's going to be some traction with this stuff.

[17:28:48:12]
But I really was thinking Elvis on my resume would look pretty I mean not that I need anybody on my resume but Elvis would be a nice one.

[17:29:00:15]
So.

[17:29:01:14]
So...

[17:29:02:14]
What did you think of Bob Joyce?

[17:29:04:14]
I liked him.

[17:29:05:14]
Kind.

[17:29:06:14]
Very kind.

[17:29:07:14]
Friendly.

[17:29:08:14]
Last the other night when for his album release he walked over to me.

[17:29:15:02]
He was excited and wasn't sure if I'd be there.

[17:29:17:10]
And there wasn't a lot of the band guys there.

[17:29:19:17]
I think Danny Duncan came.

[17:29:21:08]
And myself.

[17:29:22:23]
And I was excited to be there.

[17:29:27:17]
And when and I thought well he's way over there he's not going to see me.

[17:29:30:15]
What happened is I came over and talked to you and your partner and all of a sudden when I walked back he walks over and he goes "I was wondering who else might be there and I saw you."

[17:29:39:22]
So you can't tell I'm seated but I'm really tall.

[17:29:44:03]
And he said "I saw you sticking ahead above and I was so tickled that you were here."

[17:29:47:19]
And he came over and gave me a hug.

[17:29:49:20]
And I hugged him back and I said "Wow what a ride."

[17:29:53:09]
Who would have thought?

[17:29:54:22]
Who would have thought?

[17:29:56:13]
And I didn't want to call him granddad but well he's probably too young for that but I uh uncle or something.

[17:30:10:03]
He made me feel like family.

[17:30:14:07]
And then his wife I might throw in what a sweetheart of a woman who embraced Joni and they ended up chatting and now we're going to go we'll see them or have breakfast lunch dinner with him somewhere and he invited me up to wherever he is in Arkansas and I just thought these people are wonderful and a lot of the people that came with him I thought these are genuine people.

[17:30:39:11]
I couldn't remember anybody's name.

[17:30:42:21]
They all came up to me and went great to see you and they hugged me and I think George was one of them that took all the pictures the camera guy for him and Tina who served just always made sure that I mean everybody it was like family.

[17:30:56:20]
So I don't mean to ramble on but it was family.

[17:31:00:22]
It's one of the most interesting things about them.

[17:31:03:07]
The actual family that follows us that are devout to him.

[17:31:07:00]
And not because of who he might have been but who he is now.

[17:31:11:09]
And you know I've always looked at it in church world pastor world work your mom and dad the trickle down effect or that trickle down thing of learning that someone is willing to lead by serving.

[17:31:36:08]
I can't imagine Bob not going in the church and thinking "Well this toilet needs to to be clean I guess I'll clean it myself.

[17:31:42:07]
I mean he struck me as that kind of guy.

[17:31:44:08]
And I just think about that and didn't expect anything different from the entourage of countless people.

[17:31:52:19]
I think in the studio there might have been 20 25.

[17:31:56:21]
Every time I walked into the lounge 'cause they got run out of the control room 'cause they were all having such marveling at everything that was happening.

[17:32:05:01]
So I go into the lounge and they're all in there.

[17:32:07:17]
And as soon as I walk in it's Hey Dennis there's the drummer.

[17:32:10:12]
Hey Dennis do you need anything?

[17:32:13:17]
People that I mean the servitude was incredible.

[17:32:20:08]
What do you think of the story or how impactful the story could be if this man truly became the most famous person on the planet?

[17:32:30:07]
(laughing) And gives it all away for Christ?

[17:32:33:01]
You know I mean what an amazing thing.

[17:32:42:13]
How many people would do that?

[17:32:46:10]
I mean I'm sure the list would be short and we've heard a lot.

[17:32:52:05]
Disciples walked away from everything their families.

[17:32:55:14]
And you think about our Lord and Savior Jesus who had the power over the universe from his dad and let people abuse him and had dirty feet and taught his disciples how to you know it's kind of like us washing a car.

[17:33:23:13]
Hey I'm over washing your car.

[17:33:25:16]
I'm going to wash your car.

[17:33:26:16]
Is that okay?"

[17:33:27:16]
People would look at you and go "What?"

[17:33:29:02]
But for someone to give everything away to serve.

[17:33:33:12]
I'll tell you what if you were closer it's a church I'd probably want to go to.

[17:33:38:09]
I mean when I had heard you know thinking about that the possibilities of this story I mean I'm dumbfounded actually.

[17:33:51:18]
And I go "Lord Jesus give me some of that.

[17:33:55:09]
Help me."

[17:33:56:09]
Because I know that it's kind of like I have to do the...

[17:34:00:17]
It's like hanging on a cliff and the Lord sends an angel to you.

[17:34:09:16]
Or somehow somebody drops you know and you're just going "Lord help me help me."

[17:34:14:23]
And then he drops a line and you go "No no no Lord.

[17:34:19:23]
That's not what I...

[17:34:20:23]
No give me something else.

[17:34:21:23]
Lord why didn't you help me?"

[17:34:22:23]
And she goes "Well I dropped the line."

[17:34:23:23]
You know I dropped the line.

[17:34:24:23]
There is a story it's a skit that I used to do touring about hanging off a cliff and an angel would fly by and couldn't believe that it was an angel that the angel could be trusted.

[17:34:38:12]
And just those things of the Lord sending things it's kind of like just reach out.

[17:34:44:23]
And I'm thinking how many times have I been prompted to give and maybe I didn't?

[17:34:55:20]
And then to think of someone that gave in this modern day gave everything to serve Christ.

[17:35:05:09]
I hate to use the word we all but wow.

[17:35:10:13]
Or Yowzers. (laughs)  You keep joking it would be the second greatest story ever told.

[17:35:16:08]
Yes.

[17:35:17:08]
It's a sacrifice you know it's an absolute dying to self.

[17:35:20:08]
It's the purest form of it the biggest form of it anyway.

[17:35:22:19]
Absolutely.

[17:35:23:19]
And I think a lot of what I think I'm starting to gather some of the special thing about the people who are surrounding him are trying to do that themselves.

[17:35:32:19]
Yeah.

[17:35:33:19]
And so whether it turns out that he is or he isn't it doesn't matter what it's made them do is reach deep inside themselves and become a new.

[17:35:39:19]
Or think of the people that just come it's probably I know this is all over the internet and has been for probably a long time and sorry that I don't know all that but think of the people that venture to the church in Arkansas just to check it out and then experience whatever their worship program is with Luther Ray drumming.

[17:36:04:06]
I met Luther Ray.

[17:36:05:23]
And then they hear this man speak and proclaim the gospel.

[17:36:12:23]
If for nothing else people that wander to Arkansas to see if it really could be Elvis and then they walk away fulfilled in some spiritual way some kind of a healing of emotion emotion attitude physical or just giving their life to Christ.

[17:36:36:04]
Nothing wrong with that.

[17:36:40:04]
Nothing wrong at all.

[17:36:42:14]
That will sell.

[17:36:44:04]
And when I say sell I mean in the spirit of everything in the universe.

[17:36:51:03]
That'll...

[17:36:55:03]
That has legs.

[17:36:58:03]
It's literally the current thesis of the film is in fact our working title is In Search of the King.

[17:37:04:03]
You show up looking for Elvis and you find him.

[17:37:07:03]
I think that what you're out there fishing with and what you end up with is sort of the hook of the movie versus what you leave with.

[17:37:20:03]
I think Brown is something pretty special here.

[17:37:23:03]
Well thank you.

[17:37:24:03]
I'm sorry I looked at him.

[17:37:26:03]
I'm I being a stage person I find people that are smiling from the drum kit.

[17:37:35:17]
And he's kind of you know there's a bright light right there with a dude standing.

[17:37:43:04]
And I hope I didn't ramble on too much and hopefully I gave you some edit points where you go "Snipp."

[17:37:48:13]
Thank you.

[17:37:49:13]
You're tremendous.

[17:37:50:13]
Thank you.

[17:37:51:13]
Wait I gotta ask.

[17:37:52:12]
I gotta ask.

[17:37:53:12]
Oh here we go.

[17:37:54:12]
Let's put it in percentages.

[17:37:55:12]
What are the chances?

[17:37:56:12]
Where do you go on the theory that is he or is he not Elvis?

[17:38:05:12]
Wow I'm not sure if I can even answer that.

[17:38:08:12]
Because I'm normally I believe in miracles.

[17:38:11:12]
I was found dead once.

[17:38:13:12]
No I wasn't.

[17:38:14:12]
My son's a doctor.

[17:38:15:12]
He goes "Dad you weren't dead."

[17:38:16:12]
Dead means dead. you're not coming back.

[17:38:20:15]
I got into cycling distance cycling here because I can't surf or snow ski.

[17:38:25:11]
And so accident Williamson County flying down a hill because I know the hill deer jumped off hit me here took my life spun me around everything around this was broken.

[17:38:38:04]
And I was in another place.

[17:38:42:01]
I was instantly in another place.

[17:38:45:18]
As a matter of fact my records show that I was verbal and visibly and verbally disappointed that I had been resuscitated.

[17:38:55:04]
Because I was in a place of no pain and beauty that I can't describe.

[17:39:00:17]
And I came back I was brought back by a cardiologist a cardiologist was the first one to me and he said it took him over a minute to bring me back.

[17:39:11:14]
Because of the blood of Christ death has no sting.

[17:39:15:11]
And when I was brought back there was a lot of pain and I've spoken about it.

[17:39:23:17]
And I think about the miracle of being allowed on the other side just for a bit.

[17:39:32:01]
My son was neuro and he transferred to another practice but he said "Dad the fact that you remember leaving you remember the moment as you were about to impact."

[17:39:43:01]
I remember the Episcopalians say "We go Lord have mercy Christ have mercy."

[17:39:47:14]
And I remember thinking "This is going to be bad."

[17:39:49:21]
I stood up to get ready to get away from the bike and I was going to say "Lord have mercy."

[17:39:55:05]
And I remember "Lord and that's all I got.

[17:39:58:04]
And I went through a veil and there was no pain.

[17:40:04:12]
And what was 45 and a half minutes of my reality of being unconscious and I mean I was resuscitated he got a faint heart rate but I didn't wake up for almost 46 minutes was that.

[17:40:20:18]
And my concept of afterlife is we are in a place of rest.

[17:40:26:05]
You feel the Spirit it's not like you see it because people go "Oh did you see anybody?"

[17:40:28:22]
And I go "No and I Scripture doesn't seem to back that up."

[17:40:33:10]
And they said did you see a white light?

[17:40:36:08]
I said my son's neuro.

[17:40:37:11]
He said the white light is if you're dying a different death the brain just goes the light goes like a camera and then it's over.

[17:40:46:17]
For me I was instantaneously in another place because I was instantaneously taken.

[17:40:52:13]
Life was taken for me.

[17:40:54:18]
So I believe in miracles.

[17:40:57:14]
I believe in miracles.

[17:40:58:14]
What's your percentage?

[17:40:59:14]
That's me Mike.

[17:41:01:14]
See that's why she's here. 95% and I Just to look at someone that could be Elvis I Mean it'd be pretty dang cool percentage.

[17:41:14:16]
I don't know I don't think I don't think I can but you know what but I Believe it could be it could be you've shown me scars boy bluff Jesus show me your scars I'll believe you when I see your scars.

[17:41:34:08]
And think about those who believed that didn't see the scars.

[17:41:38:08]
But to think that Bob could be Elvis?

[17:41:44:08]

[17:41:49:08]

[17:41:53:08]

[17:41:56:08]

[17:41:57:08]
Did I say you wanted a number from me?

[17:41:59:08]
I don't know but you know what?

[17:42:02:07]
