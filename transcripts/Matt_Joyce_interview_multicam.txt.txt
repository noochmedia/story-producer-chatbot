I live in Benton grew up in Benton was born in Texas.

[02:21:55:00]
Wait hold on a second.

[02:21:59:00]
You want to do it the way you want to do it.

[02:22:04:23]
I'm alright with you.

[02:22:06:23]
[ Inaudible ]

[02:22:20:23]
Flip this.

[02:22:21:23]
Yep.

[02:22:23:11]
Yep.

[02:22:23:23]
Yep.

[02:22:24:23]
It's all that hairs grabbing it.

[02:22:26:23]
Do you see it there?

[02:22:28:23]
[ Inaudible ]

[02:22:35:23]
All right sorry.

[02:22:37:16]
It's all right.

[02:22:38:07]
Yes go ahead.

[02:22:39:15]
My name is Matthew Charo Joyce and I grew up in Benton born in Texas.

[02:22:45:13]
We lived in a little town Kennedale I was born in Fort Worth.

[02:22:49:05]
The hospital was just down the road.

[02:22:52:07]
Interesting thing throughout life going from Texas to Arkansas every house that we've ever had is demolished or has fallen down.

[02:23:02:02]
It's kind of strange to go back to the block we lived in and Benton and you're looking for the house to show somebody hey this is where I grew up.

[02:23:09:12]
And I'm like where's the house?

[02:23:11:20]
You find that the guy we were renting from Mr. Smallwood and I went and found him and I was like man what happened to the house?

[02:23:17:11]
And he's like one day I just came over and it fell over.

[02:23:21:00]
So it's a strange time to go back through and not be able to see anything where you grew up where you were born where you're at.

[02:23:28:11]
When we moved from that house and moved out kind of more in the woods and benton.

[02:23:32:17]
You know it's now I went to college you know?

[02:23:35:10]
So it's always strange coming home you know went out to Branson did some acting.

[02:23:40:19]
I did Elvis on the road for 20 years back to the rock and roll thing you know and played into a rock and roll band the Getty's you know?

[02:23:48:15]
And then I started writing music you know?

[02:23:50:21]
So everything's been music it's been acting.

[02:23:52:19]
I got to be Sam Phillips the guy who found Elvis Johnny Cash Carl Perkins Jared Lee Lewis I'm on a show called Million Dollar Quartet.

[02:23:59:14]
And I actually got to run the show a little bit too and do some stage production management and as I was being Sam Phillips.

[02:24:06:03]
So I got to dabble in a little bit of everything.

[02:24:08:14]
So life to me has just been entertainment and music and love of life and traveling and getting a taste a little bit here and a little taste there.

[02:24:17:11]
So that's kind of my life man.

[02:24:20:03]
I've had my ups and downs and struggles just like everybody else.

[02:24:22:16]
God always pulls me through brings me out ahead somehow.

[02:24:28:12]
So I'm thankful anyways.

[02:24:29:19]
That's fantastic.

[02:24:30:15]
So tell me a little bit about growing up.

[02:24:32:04]
How'd you guys grow up?

[02:24:34:04]
Well we grew up we were totally poor.

[02:24:36:09]
We never went without.

[02:24:39:09]
Mom always had something for us to eat.

[02:24:42:05]
Dad's always out working sweating but he was a contractor man.

[02:24:47:12]
Building houses putting roofs on them doing trim.

[02:24:50:06]
And I had a real gift for like woodwork.

[02:24:52:12]
I think if he would have done what he really loved He'd probably been a carver carving wood and making things beautiful.

[02:24:58:16]
But instead he went out and he's building houses and add-ons.

[02:25:02:12]
But dad always held on to a simplicity of life.

[02:25:07:21]
It didn't seem like he needed a bunch of stuff.

[02:25:09:23]
So we weren't out after the big jobs and he didn't always have these big sometimes we're down at the hill helping out the poor folks.

[02:25:17:16]
And dad would be down there and it wasn't the biggest paychecks coming home.

[02:25:21:04]
So it was like it was still a struggle but there was always love.

[02:25:24:10]
There's always church you know we grew up in church you know so we went to tent revivals to tent revivals to My gosh man so many of them I can't even remember little little churches down in Dixonville would go out there a lot you know And the community come together people sing and you know sometimes we'd have preachers up there and had a like a five-minute preacher bell You know these guys would get up preach out the Holy Spirit and God and Jesus for five full minutes But bang you know It's time for the next preacher to come up and all these little churches from all around these neighborhoods and communities man and come out and people would eat and we'd go to their houses.

[02:25:56:16]
And I just remember Bible study all my life.

[02:26:00:10]
You know what I mean?

[02:26:01:06]
Like I don't remember a time growing up that we didn't have something going on in the church.

[02:26:06:10]
Dad wasn't a pastor yet but he didn't feel called to for that yet.

[02:26:10:04]
He was just out preaching and singing under somebody else's church.

[02:26:14:14]
And a lot of times it'd be just being somebody's house.

[02:26:17:14]
I remember years and years and years with the Dotsons and the Coulters and these people man that were just like real big influences in our lives and people that are our friends.

[02:26:27:17]
And had a bunch of kids and my mom would take care of all the Sunday school stuff.

[02:26:32:19]
And dad would be in there with the adults and he was always preaching and giving a Bible study.

[02:26:37:21]
And they'd been there pushing it back and forth.

[02:26:39:16]
And it was interesting times for us because we weren't really in church.

[02:26:44:21]
We were really in houses.

[02:26:47:01]
And it was like he was still after the Lord going.

[02:26:49:16]
He wasn't preaching quite yet.

[02:26:51:06]
I mean what am I saying?

[02:26:52:06]
He was preaching all his life you know but he wasn't a pastor yet.

[02:26:55:21]
Yeah so it was awesome going through it.

[02:26:57:16]
You know we went to black churches you know we went to any church to take that in and let him sing let him preach you know and so it was always really cool.

[02:27:05:12]
There was a wild time at some point dad had broke his leg you know his ankle shattered sawdust and fell off the roof of a house.

[02:27:14:09]
And he didn't nobody was going to church man.

[02:27:16:14]
No one was having Bible studies and it was so weird You know and you could feel like you can almost feel the tension when mom was like come on kids we're going to church.

[02:27:25:02]
You know so the mom was like she grabbed us up and we learned about like conventional praise and worship music you know and we're listening to you know to all kinds of different stuff we didn't grow up with.

[02:27:36:02]
You know now it's like a whole you know different kind of group of people.

[02:27:40:03]
I went to a different church after that and you know with a bunch of kids and you know I was chasing that you know I was chasing the Lord through friends You know what I mean?

[02:27:48:15]
You know the church I was going to nobody's got it figured out.

[02:27:52:16]
You know at some point we got into a big mess man.

[02:27:57:16]
It's just kind of what people believe.

[02:28:00:04]
That starts making people against each other.

[02:28:02:15]
You realize that really it's just God and Jesus.

[02:28:06:02]
You know what I mean?

[02:28:07:05]
So all these differences come into play and that church stops and I start going to another church and I go find myself into the world.

[02:28:13:15]
The entertainment circuit and it's strange to find yourself all the way back I'm back at church with my mom and dad helping out called to honor my mom and dad.

[02:28:22:01]
So my life has been a rock and roll fest.

[02:28:27:01]
We go down the line man any music venue I could play I played it.

[02:28:31:13]
Any place that would take us in we did it.

[02:28:33:12]
We were kitchen soap and little rock in surrounding areas for a while.

[02:28:37:09]
You just turn on the radio there's the Gettys.

[02:28:40:09]
I call myself Matt Getty had a different kind of stage name type of deal.

[02:28:43:16]
We're like a family.

[02:28:44:20]
We were pushing family but it was rock and roll anyways.

[02:28:47:21]
Right.

[02:28:49:01]
Well that's the guy for me.

[02:28:50:02]
Am I missing anything?

[02:28:51:04]
Yeah I thought about that love of music.

[02:28:52:17]
Was your house a musical household?

[02:28:54:23]
Yeah dad was he's always playing music.

[02:28:59:00]
Dad I say always when he had something on his mind he's like on that piano on that piano boy he's pulling out songs.

[02:29:06:17]
Being a young man I can't even remember how old he was.

[02:29:10:08]
He was in the studio recording and it was really cool to go in and see all these producers and stuff you know sitting around and thinking about how the song's gonna go.

[02:29:19:17]
And you know dad just you know listening.

[02:29:21:20]
And so I just got I was a little fly on the wall because I you know I'd be annoying if I was too loud.

[02:29:26:04]
So I had to kind of sit there and just listen.

[02:29:28:02]
Yeah.

[02:29:28:09]
So I learned a lot about music and a lot about recording and a lot about you know how it feels you know what I mean?

[02:29:33:10]
And dad's totally a feeling kind of guy you know when it's when it's singing you know it's totally emotional.

[02:29:39:02]
And so you can sit back sometimes just take it for granted too you know you I was getting careful when I was a kid.

[02:29:46:04]
Remember he'd be playing.

[02:29:47:20]
Anybody would sit down and listen to the beautiful music coming out of him but sometimes he'd be running outside and inside.

[02:29:51:21]
But you get enough of it you're like wow this is kind of the influence of my life.

[02:29:56:08]
Wasn't a whole lot of radio wasn't a whole lot of CDs being played.

[02:30:01:13]
It's mostly I was playing music.

[02:30:04:19]
Sabrina did my sister Sabrina she loves Sandy Patty when she was kids man.

[02:30:09:19]
So there's a lot of Sandy Patty going on in the house.

[02:30:12:00]
I could sing a lot of that.

[02:30:14:04]
My mom was real big on the Salty's Praise and Worship kids' books and it was like an audio thing where there was a book and it was teaching the kids about the Word of God and we learned our ABCs.

[02:30:25:05]
All of a sudden it comes short of the glory of God.

[02:30:26:22]
Romans 3.23 believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and now shall we save ABCD all the way through Z. But it was such a time for music too because all those audio tapes had the Salty's Praise and Worship songs.

[02:30:39:13]
♪ 'Cause I'm a child of the king if I have you ♪ ♪ And I have everything ♪ So it was beautiful to hear music like that but it wasn't like Led Zeppelin.

[02:30:49:10]
It wasn't listening to Elvis.

[02:30:50:21]
It wasn't listening to the Rolling Stones.

[02:30:52:17]
It wasn't we didn't have that in the house man.

[02:30:54:14]
That was rock and roll.

[02:30:56:00]
That's probably why I went into rock and roll when I got a little older and all the kids were listening to Megadeth and Pantera and Ozzy Osbourne and stuff.

[02:31:02:19]
And I'm like "Man what is all this?"

[02:31:04:07]
You know what I mean?

[02:31:05:03]
Like I started listening to rock and roll.

[02:31:08:23]
So it was interesting to grow up in it because like even now people when I'm playing music for somebody they're like You don't know the song and I'm like you know kind of embarrassed by it you know I'm like no I don't you know the Beatles I didn't grow up listening to the Beatles.

[02:31:21:18]
So people are like yes Beatles song like it's a Beatles song Like you don't know this is a Beatles song.

[02:31:25:04]
I'm like I don't know it's a Beatles song you know So I've learned about music as I go even now But the house was full of music because you know the house is full of the Lord you know everybody was praising worship.

[02:31:36:21]
Dad was always putting his heart out for it.

[02:31:39:06]
Mom was pushing it and my sister was pushing it.

[02:31:42:07]
He talked to my brother.

[02:31:43:13]
He played in bands all grown up.

[02:31:45:03]
Everything is about the Lord all Christian music.

[02:31:47:10]
It's just a household full of music.

[02:31:50:03]
We couldn't help it.

[02:31:50:22]
Everybody kind of got the bug.

[02:31:52:04]
I remember being 16 years old.

[02:31:53:10]
Me and my boys man we were going to church together.

[02:31:55:08]
We were like "We done heard about metal music in the Christian scene."

[02:31:58:14]
So me and Michael Moore my boy Michael man we We go out and went to Cornerstone.

[02:32:03:19]
It's a festival in Bushnell Illinois.

[02:32:05:11]
And it was all these bands man that we'd never seen.

[02:32:08:11]
We'd just heard of it because we'd just gotten a taste of it.

[02:32:10:11]
It was a band in Little Rock called Living Sacrifice.

[02:32:12:07]
I don't know if you know them but really heavy music man.

[02:32:14:18]
Really heavy music but it's all godly.

[02:32:17:03]
And so we went out to Cornerstone man.

[02:32:18:21]
When we come back we're like we're playing in a band.

[02:32:22:04]
So I was the bass player and Michael was the screamer.

[02:32:24:18]
Well we couldn't find a drummer.

[02:32:26:00]
So I'm like well I'll be the drummer then.

[02:32:27:09]
I'll be the drummer.

[02:32:28:15]
So we did that for a while. and found this guy I wanted to play the guitar.

[02:32:32:09]
We played with him for a little bit.

[02:32:34:04]
It was in the house man.

[02:32:37:00]
It was in the house my mom and dad's house.

[02:32:39:04]
I'm like oh my gosh I'm like we're gonna practice I'm like my house.

[02:32:42:23]
We're gonna practice this rock and roll music at your house?

[02:32:45:04]
I'm like it's Christian music.

[02:32:46:03]
My mom and dad will say yeah.

[02:32:47:14]
So man we're a little video house and here's my little room and here's mom and dad's little room and here's the kitchen here's the small bedroom.

[02:32:54:22]
Everything was just real tight and packed man.

[02:32:56:20]
And I am with a drum set double bass. (imitates guitar) And all these guys screaming and playing heavy music.

[02:33:03:05]
Oh my gosh they put up with so much.

[02:33:05:06]
But they let me you know what I mean?

[02:33:06:22]
And they weren't upset any time.

[02:33:09:01]
Hey man you're in a secular band?

[02:33:10:23]
They didn't go like oh shame on you.

[02:33:13:06]
So it was like the gift the gift of love in music.

[02:33:17:04]
I believe it's a revolution.

[02:33:19:22]
The only revolution I think can come besides Jesus feeling the hearts of men and the cloud of witnesses and stuff like that.

[02:33:26:13]
But like a revolution of music I think it's spawn all that off.

[02:33:29:17]
And that's why I'm here for man.

[02:33:30:20]
I'm here for the hearts of people man.

[02:33:32:05]
I think that I think that love and rock and roll and people's hearts I mean that's all connected man.

[02:33:37:21]
And you can speak any way we want to.

[02:33:40:14]
You can speak life into any way you speak.

[02:33:43:12]
You can speak death in any way you speak you know.

[02:33:45:11]
And we ain't gotta go hey Jesus Jesus Jesus.

[02:33:48:14]
But we can go like hey look at the way I'm talking.

[02:33:51:00]
Look at the way I'm living.

[02:33:52:02]
Yeah I make mistakes but I love you.

[02:33:54:14]
You know and I think music is a universal language you know and no matter what kind of I went to Guatemala to do a house mission trip and built a house over there.

[02:34:06:07]
We realized that that communication breakdown it went away with music and the heart.

[02:34:13:06]
So I brought a guitar with me and me and the guys were jamming out and these guys brought a guitar and a harmonica and every once in a while we'd stop and we'd play the music.

[02:34:20:05]
So even though we couldn't speak to each other with the same language we could speak to each other with love.

[02:34:25:11]
And those kids knew that I was there for them that there was no guile in me at all.

[02:34:29:12]
And I don't know what they have to deal with.

[02:34:31:07]
But I think that's the same way with even being here in America I mean with music we all speak the same language.

[02:34:37:00]
But when you've got the feelings of music behind it then also we're speaking a different language.

[02:34:42:19]
But we're speaking the same language.

[02:34:44:15]
It's like so I think music if we didn't have music in our household our lives would all look different. we would be on a different desolate kind of journey.

[02:34:55:16]
So anyways.

[02:34:57:07]
Hey tell me what is the Getty's family thing?

[02:34:59:14]
I didn't follow that.

[02:35:00:13]
The Getty's man so it was just rock and roll band we had and these guys.

[02:35:05:00]
So Todd Mills let me talk about him for a second.

[02:35:07:20]
Every year I do a benefit for Todd Mills and he died of cancer geoblastoma.

[02:35:12:20]
But he also created Doritos Tacos Locos.

[02:35:16:22]
It was his idea did it on MySpace and come up with all these ideas.

[02:35:20:15]
They did his business called him from Chicago and said Hey you want to come up and pick your taco?

[02:35:24:11]
So he really is credited for it but even though he didn't get the money credit for it but Todd Mills man he he was uh in another band called Daisy chain.

[02:35:32:16]
All of a sudden they were looking for a new singer.

[02:35:34:13]
I walked in the door cause I just started doing Elvis the same day.

[02:35:38:21]
This guy gave me a microphone and I met this Elvis guy in a restaurant.

[02:35:42:23]
So all at the same day converges forces.

[02:35:45:21]
I'm coming in to get this microphone worked on to do Elvis shows.

[02:35:49:11]
And this guy goes hey don't you sing?

[02:35:51:10]
I'm like yes I've seen you at this karaoke open mic night thing.

[02:35:54:23]
He goes we're looking for a singer in our band.

[02:35:57:03]
And Todd Mills man.

[02:35:59:06]
Anyway so he created this thing and we called it the Getty's.

[02:36:02:14]
The Getty's the Vatican's the Baskies all these people that rule the world.

[02:36:06:23]
We were just kinda doing a spinoff play off of it.

[02:36:09:12]
And so we called ourselves the Getty's.

[02:36:12:06]
But what it turned into is like a family thing.

[02:36:14:13]
We were like hey man we're reaching out to people out there that are broken hearted.

[02:36:17:20]
We were playing playing that funky music and some tool music and Prince and 80s rock and anything that gets you up dancing and feeling it.

[02:36:27:09]
It's kind of get away from that everyday moment and that grind working and just try to take your mind away from it.

[02:36:33:12]
And I thought inside myself man this is where God wants me with people.

[02:36:38:07]
And they weren't a Christian band by any means.

[02:36:40:07]
We were out there drinking and throwing down but we loved each other.

[02:36:43:23]
There was a lot of family involved in it.

[02:36:45:08]
So we started calling them you know like the girls came out and they named themselves the Gettys girls.

[02:36:50:01]
The Gettys girls were like our family you know I mean they could come out to our show and they could dance.

[02:36:54:08]
And if someone was messing with them man I had enough in me.

[02:36:57:20]
I'd be like hey boys get on out of here.

[02:36:59:13]
I get people kicked out of there I'd get in their face.

[02:37:01:10]
But like they knew they were protected you know.

[02:37:03:10]
So when you come to a Gettys show man if somebody started a fight you know it's like stop the music stop the music.

[02:37:09:05]
Hey hey you know cut it out.

[02:37:11:05]
You know we felt like it was kind of like our job and our responsibility to make sure everybody was safe.

[02:37:14:22]
You know parking lots were safe and the girls were being walked out and before you know it man It was like family family family everybody wanted to see the Gettys everybody wanted to be a part of the Gettys show man And we we changed songs cover band stuff but we changed the songs for the Gettys You know I wish I had a Gettys girl You know it's all fun stuff But then we started writing music a little bit here and there and I realized that that was kind of the trail I was after the guys couldn't go and I couldn't hit the road You know things happen but you know we started doing that monsters of Todd and it got us back together You know so once a year we get together and we play some play a show for some charity We pick somebody's got cancer and and we'll give all the money to the family You know everybody gives their time everybody gives their sources everybody everybody gives everything you know and It's like what a beautiful hearted thing what a beautiful hearted thing you know and you know and that's what we're out doing Just trying to touch hearts.

[02:38:07:09]
You know I think the only thing that wasn't there was was a lot of Jesus It should have been more even though it was there and it was throughout the little spreads and sprinkles of it I think I could have been more proactive in loving people with some truth instead of just loving people in their moment.

[02:38:21:15]
Which hey man that goes a long way.

[02:38:23:22]
People in their hurt hey I'm hurt everybody's hurt but in their moment you find each other out there and you know man it felt really good to have someone who understood.

[02:38:34:11]
I think a lot of that was so honest so honest of loving each other.

[02:38:40:20]
Even the guys in the group man we had no rules with each other.

[02:38:43:21]
We were just trying to make the best thing out of what we had.

[02:38:47:22]
It's like hey let's do it bigger.

[02:38:49:15]
Let's do it bigger next time.

[02:38:50:17]
But they're loving it.

[02:38:51:08]
Hey let's do it even more.

[02:38:52:21]
Let's invite everybody to the float trip.

[02:38:55:02]
We were doing these huge big things man.

[02:38:57:11]
And it was just a lot of love and a lot of fun and got a lot of great friends out of it.

[02:39:01:13]
The Gettys man the Gettys.

[02:39:03:04]
And all under capitalized letter no capitalization.

[02:39:06:11]
And I sure bothered people the Gettys with no capitalized.

[02:39:10:21]
But just the boys man and no apostrophe so the Gettys.

[02:39:14:08]
Now wait you said the same day you were also starting to take up elements.

[02:39:18:04]
How did that come about?

[02:39:19:20]
Barry Humphries I was working at Outback Steakhouse.

[02:39:22:14]
My first Pizza Hut and Benton I was like 16 years old and I was bringing a guitar into the room and I learned Unchained Melody.

[02:39:31:08]
And I started singing at the tables and stuff.

[02:39:33:07]
And this older couple come in and they're like can you sing some Elvis songs?

[02:39:36:16]
And I'm like I ain't like I don't even know any Elvis songs.

[02:39:40:04]
I'm like so I give them a hard time about it and they give me a hard time about it.

[02:39:43:12]
Well they kept coming in kept coming in kept coming in.

[02:39:45:11]
I wish I knew who they were their names but at one day I was like you know what am I learning?

[02:39:49:12]
So I learned Heartbreak Hotel man.

[02:39:50:20]
I popped up and called it.

[02:39:51:20]
Well since my baby left me.

[02:39:54:06]
You know and I just became the Elvis singer at this Pizza Hut.

[02:39:57:09]
And it was just a lot of fun.

[02:39:58:22]
And then from place to place Now I'm starting to sing for my tables and I'm at Outback Steakhouse and a big money over there man.

[02:40:04:17]
And um I would make better money singing at my tables.

[02:40:07:18]
And so the people waiting tables with me you know they were like Hey man you you're over singing all the time.

[02:40:13:11]
And you know we ain't getting none of this.

[02:40:14:10]
I'll tell you what why don't you guys let y'all run my food.

[02:40:17:09]
You run your food and anybody who wants me to come sing at their table.

[02:40:21:03]
I'll do it.

[02:40:21:11]
You know so I'd have waiters come Hey go over to 42 man go to the hole.

[02:40:25:09]
There's there's people over there singing and you know they want Elvis.

[02:40:28:07]
And I'm like all right.

[02:40:28:22]
So we're in the hole was called it was the hole 42 North Little Rock outback steakhouse and that's the worst place to get a table.

[02:40:36:10]
You know it's all the way in the backs by the to go place.

[02:40:38:20]
Well man there was this Elvis dude sitting there Barry Humphries.

[02:40:41:07]
And he's looking at his eight by tens.

[02:40:42:19]
They're like Hey Matt man you've got to come check this guy out.

[02:40:45:11]
And I was like well my gosh cause I never seen no Elvis personator no Elvis tribute artists.

[02:40:49:16]
You learn that's the right way to say it.

[02:40:51:08]
I thought it was impersonator but if you say that man you get strung up man.

[02:40:54:06]
Strong up straight strong up. about Elvis tribute artist Barry Humphries.

[02:40:58:18]
And he's looking at these eight by tens and he's going like man which one am I gonna do?

[02:41:01:20]
And I was like and they're like that's like I gotta get him.

[02:41:04:03]
I gotta get him let me have him.

[02:41:05:12]
And so I ran over to him and it popped up my collars.

[02:41:07:14]
I said hey man.

[02:41:08:10]
And he looked over and I said since my baby left me.

[02:41:11:05]
And I did my whole little routine at him and he's just laughing.

[02:41:13:22]
But he's like hey you know you're actually pretty good at that.

[02:41:16:11]
You don't think about doing it.

[02:41:17:07]
And he gives me his card.

[02:41:19:03]
I'm like well okay.

[02:41:20:11]
And I stick with him and I'm laughing about it.

[02:41:22:03]
And I was going to UCA college for marketing at the time.

[02:41:24:22]
And I was they had a faculty teachers and staff day and they really wanted me to come perform.

[02:41:31:10]
They're like "Hey man we heard you like sing Elvis."

[02:41:33:03]
I'm like "Well man I know a couple of songs."

[02:41:35:04]
And they're like "We heard that you do Elvis you do funny jokes you can do..."

[02:41:39:06]
I'm like "Man I'll tell you what let me call this guy and if I can hook it up I'll come back and I'll do the show for you."

[02:41:45:01]
And they're like "All right."

[02:41:46:02]
And I was like "All right man."

[02:41:46:22]
And I'm taking a total leg out on it.

[02:41:49:12]
And so I call him and he's like "Yeah man come over.

[02:41:51:20]
I'll give you a CD with some songs.

[02:41:53:19]
I'll give you an outfit and teach you how to do your hair.

[02:41:57:08]
So I went over to his house man and he spent the time with me to he's like you know you gotta be with the people and you gotta love 'em and you look at 'em and just pay attention to Elvis and see what he did and all these things you know?

[02:42:08:08]
And I was like that's really cool man.

[02:42:09:12]
And I was like I'm doing this man.

[02:42:10:23]
And so I get this microphone from this guy at Outback Steakhouse and he goes here dude I want you to have this mic.

[02:42:16:11]
And I'm like that is awesome.

[02:42:18:05]
This is an old Elvis mic.

[02:42:19:20]
Oh my gosh you know I'm so stoked.

[02:42:22:04]
And so I go to the music store And that's kind of that's where it all begins.

[02:42:25:18]
You know I got the CD I got the soundtrack I got the hair up I got the jacket gold glitter jacket and I'm ready to go man.

[02:42:32:20]
I go to the music shop Todd Mills turns me on to this other band.

[02:42:36:21]
I'm like thanks man he fixes my mic.

[02:42:38:23]
I go to the show and they give me a hundred dollars.

[02:42:41:20]
I mean a hundred dollars for 30 minutes.

[02:42:44:00]
I'm like I worked all night at Alamac's Take House on a Friday.

[02:42:47:22]
On a Friday if it's a good night I got 120.

[02:42:50:03]
And I worked all night and I sweated and I broke it down and pulled gum off the tables.

[02:42:54:14]
You know what I mean?

[02:42:55:10]
I'm like "$100 for 30 minutes.

[02:42:57:07]
"Okay I got something going here."

[02:42:59:03]
And so one night I'm waiting tables man and I'm singing doing my thing and this young couple that was in there and I was waiting on them they left me a dollar bill.

[02:43:07:17]
And they wrote on it they were like "Maybe you ought to quit waiting tables and start singing."

[02:43:12:10]
And I was like I was so brokenhearted.

[02:43:15:06]
I was like "Man I done hurt these people.

[02:43:16:23]
"I'm supposed to be waiting their table."

[02:43:18:10]
And I really you know I felt bad.

[02:43:20:17]
And I was like "You know what?

[02:43:21:13]
right.

[02:43:22:13]
These guys are right.

[02:43:22:21]
I'm quitting.

[02:43:23:10]
So I quit.

[02:43:24:08]
I quit.

[02:43:24:21]
I went into music.

[02:43:25:20]
I picked up a newspaper article about a competition going on in Milwaukee.

[02:43:29:23]
I was like I've never and barely left the state at this point in my life.

[02:43:33:21]
I mean I'm an Arkansas boy and I've gone here gone a couple of little places you know family and through California you know whatever you know but I ain't very really went anywhere.

[02:43:43:21]
But I'm like I'm going and I drove by myself in the middle of winter to Wisconsin like the place you don't want I don't want to go in the middle of winter.

[02:43:53:06]
And then oh my gosh the first day I went in there's like 10 15 Elvis guys.

[02:43:57:22]
I was like oh my God what is going on here?

[02:44:01:00]
And so I'm up now I'm a people person so I'm up hey what's up?

[02:44:04:05]
Oh my name's Al Hart.

[02:44:05:04]
And I'm like hey Al Hart friend of mine to this day one of my best buds man.

[02:44:09:22]
And I met him that day and he looking at me like what are you looking at punk?

[02:44:13:02]
What are you doing around here stepping in my scene?

[02:44:15:19]
I was like well what kind of scene is this?

[02:44:17:12]
And then day two or three man this other group of people come in They were affiliated with some Elvis group.

[02:44:23:23]
Anyways all these Elvis guys and they were I'm talking about prim proper hair dyed black makeup and her eyebrows done.

[02:44:31:04]
I was like oh my gosh.

[02:44:32:18]
I didn't know what I was into man.

[02:44:34:06]
And then we're competing against each other and I did pretty well.

[02:44:37:10]
I made some good enough money.

[02:44:39:03]
I went home was happy that I went you know and I was gone a week you know and that just caught the bug man.

[02:44:43:23]
And then I was like okay let's do this.

[02:44:46:23]
You know and that was like a $50000 competition 25000 to the winner and they broke things down later.

[02:44:52:23]
Later on I won $25000 at a competition that I started in.

[02:44:57:23]
And I just couldn't believe it man.

[02:45:00:00]
Then they brought us all back.

[02:45:01:06]
I mean I could tell a million stories about the Elvis world but the Elvis world is definitely a lovely place full of wonderful people and every time you go you're loved.

[02:45:11:11]
Every time you go it's like as soon as you hit the stage or a star then it doesn't matter who you are.

[02:45:15:20]
You know the Elvis world really is a different land. it up you know it's lovely.

[02:45:23:21]
So you didn't grow up with any Elvis music in the house?

[02:45:24:21]
No none none.

[02:45:27:12]
You know one day I remember watching TV with dad you know and I remember watching TV with dad he's hanging out I'm on his shoulder and I'm hanging on his neck and he's like well come on man and he's flicking through the channels and I'm like man and all of a sudden black leather machine black hair and this guy's up doing this thing and And I'm like whoa whoa whoa who is that?

[02:45:51:06]
You know dad whoa whoa who's that?

[02:45:52:17]
And he pulls back you ain't ever seen Elvis son?

[02:45:54:22]
And I was like my God who is that?

[02:45:56:10]
It was like a machine I'd never seen anything like it.

[02:45:58:15]
But I knew I knew I was an Elvis fan.

[02:46:00:20]
I knew I was an Elvis fan as soon as I seen it.

[02:46:02:12]
I was like oh this guy this guy ain't unlike him.

[02:46:05:23]
You know not that I'd seen that much but it was he knew.

[02:46:08:19]
There was something he knew that nobody else knew.

[02:46:11:01]
Yeah there's something about charisma that he had that nobody else had you know as part of his look part of his demeanor part of his intentions man.

[02:46:18:04]
I mean this guy had it all you know?

[02:46:20:02]
And I was like and you could see it just through a flip through of a channel.

[02:46:22:09]
I was like whoa who's that?

[02:46:23:18]
He's like you never seen Elvis son?

[02:46:24:20]
So me and dad watched a little bit of 68 Comeback special together first time I ever seen Elvis.

[02:46:29:06]
And that was to me it was a pretty incredible moment you know that I remember you know?

[02:46:33:09]
So to me it must've impacted me.

[02:46:36:16]
But it makes sense going through all the churches and all the stuff how Elvis grew up and how the similarities are of my life and seeing all the loveliness with Elvis and all the influence that he's had throughout his whole career and throughout his life.

[02:46:51:14]
But yeah that's my first experience with Elvis.

[02:46:55:05]
And later on when I started my second experience with Elvis was Michael Moore my buddy again we were into metal stuff.

[02:47:00:12]
So we were playing metal music out there but we would be driving around a '71 Dodge Demon which was my first car that I owned by the way which I bought from him.

[02:47:09:10]
And a '71 Dodge Demon we're listening to Rockabilly Elvis Good luck charm and ready teddy and all this stuff.

[02:47:17:10]
We're this back and forth on a CD player with our hair all greased up but like a metal style wearing bandanas and greasing slid off pants and a lot of fun.

[02:47:28:05]
It just made people think what the heck is going on here?

[02:47:31:15]
We have a dip in and we look like greasers walking around.

[02:47:35:02]
It was so awesome.

[02:47:36:01]
Was there any moment where you told your folks you're gonna go be an Elvis pardon me what's the term?

[02:47:42:08]
That was Tribute Art.

[02:47:44:08]
[INAUDIBLE]

[02:47:46:10]
I don't know if I remember like when I very first started I don't think I was really talking to him about it.

[02:47:54:17]
It wasn't like something that came on the table.

[02:47:56:19]
But I remember the first time that I was like dad don't go out.

[02:48:02:12]
He definitely don't go to bars definitely don't go to casinos.

[02:48:05:12]
That is just it's not gonna be found in any of the places.

[02:48:08:12]
But I remember I was doing a competition it was one of the very first ones.

[02:48:11:03]
And it was it was another big one.

[02:48:12:13]
It was another big one.

[02:48:14:12]
It's $50000 to the winner you know?

[02:48:16:16]
And uh and I was like man come on dad mom y'all come on please come out.

[02:48:20:10]
You know it's only twice that he came out.

[02:48:22:21]
One was that time and one was dentin strut line but like so that day they'd come out and uh the Jordan errors were there you know so it was really cool that I got to sing with the Jordan errors and my dad was there to see it which was really cool because you know he's a fan you know and he looks up there and sees the Jordan errors there.

[02:48:38:12]
I'm like wow man.

[02:48:39:05]
And I'm up there doing the old 50s with the Jordan airs.

[02:48:43:23]
To me that was just amazing.

[02:48:45:14]
And so it was like that was one of the times that I think that was like yeah I'll go.

[02:48:50:04]
But it was like the only one of the two.

[02:48:52:11]
The second one maybe he came three times but yeah he did come three times.

[02:48:57:05]
'Cause I did a I've got a play that I did.

[02:48:59:16]
It's an Elvis play "The King Another Christmas Carol."

[02:49:03:00]
And it's kind of like what do you call it?

[02:49:07:08]
A Christmas Carol.

[02:49:08:10]
It's like a Christmas girl except it's done with Elvis you know and the ghost of Christmas past present future or like a rockabilly ghost and one who's an angel from heaven.

[02:49:16:00]
And it's all kind of about hope instead of the gift of giving.

[02:49:19:08]
But I had dad do the narration on it you know so I traveled around the country doing the show different places when I come to Little Rock he came to that one you know.

[02:49:27:09]
And then the third one was at Dent's Trot Line when I got him to sing and you know got all over the internet anyways.

[02:49:34:04]
But that's the three times that I had ever come out you know and it was kind of surprising because there was alcohol being served in the place and dad is not you know they don't do that mom and dad don't they don't show up but they did it for me you know so the three times they did it it was really important you know and and they never seemed to like say nothing about it more than just like hey man you know good job dad'll you know it's funny every once while dad be like hey son what you saying at a no tell her Jim said hello you know I'm like huh you know what song you talking about you know he's like you know so it's a real pretty You ought to sing that and put that one in there.

[02:50:08:18]
And what was another one?

[02:50:10:18]
I won a competition with it.

[02:50:12:18]
It was like a very simple in my way very beautiful it's like a less than a two minute song.

[02:50:17:18]
And I sang it a cappella man.

[02:50:19:18]
You could have seen this place.

[02:50:20:18]
You could have heard a drop of pen in the place.

[02:50:22:18]
But it was a song that I was like "You know son you ought to sing this song."

[02:50:25:18]
It was like one of them offbeat tunes.

[02:50:27:18]
I always thought it strange that I knew all those offbeat tunes.

[02:50:30:18]
But it was a beautiful song.

[02:50:32:18]
And it actually got me to the place where I won. like a big big one and it was just the simple beautiful song.

[02:50:39:04]
Tell me what happened at Denton's that night did you have a sense you knew your dad could sing obviously you grew up with him singing.

[02:50:46:16]
Yeah of course I knew he could sing and I was like of course he sounds like Elvis more than anybody more than anybody in the whole scene.

[02:50:55:05]
I always told people in the industry I'm like man if you heard my dad sing you guys would laugh about everybody out here trying to sound like Elvis.

[02:51:01:21]
Nobody ever got it because you know dad ain't gonna come out and do it you know but I caught him that day I caught him.

[02:51:07:00]
I say you know what dad?

[02:51:07:23]
I say you guys you want to hear a real singer I say tell you what come on dad.

[02:51:11:05]
I showed the mic in his face and he's like You know he watched the video and he's he don't want to do it but he does it you know It's another moment.

[02:51:19:08]
I think he just did it for me and uh John caught it on camera you know So I thought that that was pretty funny you know and it It ain't like I've done a whole lot of shows in Arkansas you know and Benton of course I don't think I have ever done a show in Benton.

[02:51:33:07]
But that was right down the road and that's how I got him there.

[02:51:35:22]
I'm like come on dad it's a restaurant.

[02:51:37:15]
I know the guy that owns it and the guy that worked there he did lots with me for a long time.

[02:51:41:16]
I earned a clerk love the guy.

[02:51:43:07]
But yeah man he came out and I just kind of grabbed him up and he wasn't practiced he didn't know the song he couldn't figure it out.

[02:51:53:05]
And I'm like I fed him the words dad sang it and nails it.

[02:51:56:18]
People got him looking up against Elvis out there and you're like my gosh my gosh man daddy you sound like the man.

[02:52:03:01]
I mean there's not a bit that doesn't sound like him.

[02:52:05:21]
There's some little bit but maybe dad might have seen a hair better.

[02:52:09:20]
I don't know.

[02:52:10:11]
But yeah it's pretty amazing what I caught.

[02:52:14:01]
What happened on the Internet when that thing got posted?

[02:52:16:07]
Well it just kind of blew up.

[02:52:17:11]
Everybody started going Elvis Elvis Elvis Elvis.

[02:52:20:12]
And that's an interesting thing isn't it?

[02:52:23:01]
[LAUGH]

[02:52:24:11]
Yeah cuz everybody's out there.

[02:52:26:01]
I mean heck man I'm an Elvis guy man.

[02:52:27:22]
I went down the rabbit hole way before dad was exposed on the internet or whatever.

[02:52:34:00]
But I went down that rabbit hole and I know a lot about the story.

[02:52:38:06]
I know it's a very high possibility he didn't die the day they said he died.

[02:52:43:09]
Very high possibility because their signature has been signed and there's all kind of stuff that insurance wasn't turned in or whatever.

[02:52:50:12]
It never got turned in for money.

[02:52:53:15]
There's all kind of stuff. all kind of stuff no one's even asked that people that think they know I'm like I know bigger questions and you guys know that love answers to but nobody has answers to you know so the one it goes back to your old man and you're like come on that's crazy you know that's the craziest thing but I'm like you know if there's anybody in this whole world that could be able to express me they'd be my dad I promise you that and that's a strange thing to say but there ain't nobody out there that can sound like him and that ain't trying you know I mean there's people out there trying to sound like him and they can't.

[02:53:23:00]
So it's just a weird you know doppelganger thing going on you know Dad and Elvis.

[02:53:28:19]
But like I mean even his character I mean the man acts like him.

[02:53:31:14]
He always has.

[02:53:32:07]
But like maybe the quiet version.

[02:53:33:23]
Maybe he's the quiet man version of Elvis.

[02:53:36:17]
But it's definitely a strange thing you know that your dad all of a sudden this legend you know I try years and years and years to be this legend.

[02:53:44:03]
You know Dad pops out on the scene and all of a sudden the whole world's like "He's Elvis."

[02:53:48:06]
You know but they did the same thing with John Cotton.

[02:53:50:12]
They did the same Same thing with you know Ryan you know it's like you can go down that rabbit hole with anybody all of a sudden you know anybody to somebody you know and it's just wild.

[02:54:01:11]
I mean tell me your experience.

[02:54:02:11]
You went down you went down a crazy rabbit hole like no one else could go down right?

[02:54:07:11]
Yeah.

[02:54:08:11]
Because you said it's your dad.

[02:54:09:11]
Like tell me tell me when it were there times when you were like wait there's things here that seem to add up?

[02:54:17:11]
Yeah. (laughs) So it gets weird man.

[02:54:21:02]
It just gets weird.

[02:54:22:04]
Because you live a life with your dad you're not thinking about Elvis.

[02:54:26:03]
You didn't even grow up with Elvis.

[02:54:27:08]
And then you go grow up with Elvis and you know I never put that together.

[02:54:30:10]
I mean is he Elvis-y?

[02:54:31:06]
Yeah he's Elvis-y.

[02:54:32:11]
You know but then the weird stuff gets to be like I don't know what I should even say here.

[02:54:38:15]
This is so weird.

[02:54:39:15]
I would ask my dad the question of you know when he was born you know at some point in life We had this IRS guy get ahold of Robert Wayne Joyce my father.

[02:54:50:08]
And this Robert Wayne Joyce was like behind on all his IRS and they were coming at him for all this money and all this money.

[02:54:56:16]
And they realized Oh there's two Robert Wayne.

[02:54:58:08]
Joyce is born on the same day with the same birth certificate in the same hospital.

[02:55:05:08]
Born I think at about the same time.

[02:55:07:18]
I'm not really sure but I think that's really strange.

[02:55:10:06]
You know when you go down a rabbit hole and you're like Oh my dad ain't over something and go like Whoa that'd be crazy if he was it'd be crazy if he was because then you realize man also all these like birth marks and stuff I know that this chicken pock on my dad's eyebrow comes from being dropped into a fireplace because he almost died and blood was profusely spraying out of his head you know because that's what that's what he told me you know so if I looked at my dad and called him a liar boy I'll tell you what that'd be a butt-whooping but that ain't and my dad ain't a liar you know what I mean so and I've never I never asked him except one time when all this stuff comes out on the internet you go "Dad are you Elvis?"

[02:55:49:01]
Come on man.

[02:55:50:13]
If you're Elvis you owe me a lot of explanation.

[02:55:53:23]
You know what I mean?

[02:55:56:16]
They can do things with plastic surgery.

[02:55:58:03]
They can do all kinds of things but you can't change the fact that I know this man that I know this man growing up and also the fact that I've studied Elvis.

[02:56:07:00]
There is and Elvis even said it and there's a man and there's a person behind the man There's a man who's like this entertainer.

[02:56:14:15]
That's what he's talking about.

[02:56:15:12]
There's this guy Who's this fake person that you have to become to be on that stage?

[02:56:19:19]
And then there's a real man inside of it I mean I think that real man is very similar to my father I really do and I don't think that's because he is Elvis But I do think it's because he grew up like him grew up under the same kind of thing.

[02:56:31:23]
So then I go dad So are you Elvis?

[02:56:34:20]
It gets nice.

[02:56:35:04]
I'm not Elvis Okay okay we might be kin to him.

[02:56:42:22]
Is that what you're telling me dad?

[02:56:43:22]
And so you know what we go through all this thing and I'll meet you guys in the documentary thing comes up and all the stuff just went crazy wayward out there on internet and all these people were Trying to come to the hot dad's house and asking questions all these weird questions And so then even after that even after all this stuff I go you know dad I got a couple questions for you one about you your birth certificate.

[02:57:04:03]
I'd like to know about that You know that's that's that's a pretty wild one.

[02:57:07:03]
I can go down that rabbit hole but I had to do a whole bunch of other stuff I'd rather you guys do that.

[02:57:10:14]
It'd be a lot of fun.

[02:57:11:12]
Two my dad spoke to John Cartner through email.

[02:57:16:16]
He showed me and I didn't read all of it because he didn't want me to read all of it but there's conversation between my father and John Cartner.

[02:57:23:20]
Now that's crazy because John Cartner is Elvis right?

[02:57:26:23]
That's weird that Elvis and Elvis are talking together right?

[02:57:32:00]
So that's weird.

[02:57:33:07]
So I don't know what to think about any of it.

[02:57:35:14]
Are you akin to Elvis?

[02:57:36:13]
I don't know.

[02:57:37:09]
I don't even know what to say about that because my father says I might be Ken Elvis because our family over there And Mississippi side and my mom my grandma you know it's like oh my gosh you know so that's weird So then you come out you don't know what to come up with you know Is he Elvis's son?

[02:57:52:05]
Could he be Elvis's son?

[02:57:53:04]
Could he be Elvis?

[02:57:55:01]
And then you look at it.

[02:57:56:10]
You're like no man No that's none of that's true.

[02:57:58:14]
But then you got family with the Brown family.

[02:58:01:02]
You tag that family back in Browns I think there's some Browns in the in the Elvis family you know So there's all these little leafs all around but like the big leafs my dad And man enough seen him.

[02:58:11:16]
I've seen him since I've been a child and I can tell you that I know he's not Elvis But then you ask all these questions go down a rabbit hole all sudden that man starts looking just like him You know he's all his guitars are like Elvis's and I know he didn't pick them out because he's following Elvis because that's my dad But he does like those kind of guitars and that's that strange and I think it's all strange but I think it's doppled anger strange I think it's a place where dad is just an amazing man.

[02:58:35:23]
You know he's an amazing voice He's an amazing talent and I think God did it so that just like it's happening man So Jesus could be proclaimed to the world because that's all he's ever done that's all my father's ever done is proclaim Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and he's got this beautiful voice and It's just really strange that everything is similar  What's it like to cuz you studied Elvis as well obviously your dad's so well personality wise we've heard really sort of beautiful stories about how how giving Elvis is.

[02:59:11:02]
He'd give his shirt off to you back whether he had it he'd buy cat wax or the one right?

[02:59:14:22]
Yeah.

[02:59:15:14]
One of the first things we ever heard about your dad was he'd give his shirt off his back he didn't have another one.

[02:59:19:22]
Yeah he would.

[02:59:20:23]
He's always been a helping hand to people and lovely.

[02:59:24:19]
I remember people that just couldn't afford their house to be built.

[02:59:27:05]
He helped them didn't take any profit.

[02:59:29:14]
We'll be out there busting a sweat labor just to somebody have a porch that didn't get rained on or holes in the house and make sure it ain't gonna rain on the house.

[02:59:37:20]
So the time he broke his leg it's like man it's gonna rain.

[02:59:41:21]
I gotta make sure these people's house I mean it's a poor old house man.

[02:59:44:18]
These people probably didn't have anything in their living room.

[02:59:46:14]
Matter of fact I knew them.

[02:59:47:19]
I knew they didn't have anything in their living room.

[02:59:49:02]
They probably could have win a day without dad crawling up on that roof.

[02:59:52:18]
But he did it because it's hard.

[02:59:54:00]
I mean got a beautiful 71 truck.

[02:59:56:16]
He just gave away to a guy not too long ago.

[02:59:59:14]
I mean it was tip top beautiful and he gave it away.

[03:00:02:12]
You know what I mean?

[03:00:03:18]
Dad's a lovely heart you know?

[03:00:05:14]
I mean he's helped me and you know the entertainment world's just like this up and down up and down.

[03:00:10:23]
My mom and dad have always been there for me.

[03:00:12:23]
You know and at times when I'm like man what am I gonna do?

[03:00:15:07]
And I didn't ask for it.

[03:00:16:05]
I'm not like that.

[03:00:17:08]
And they ain't got nothing.

[03:00:18:10]
You know they're living off retirement money.

[03:00:20:17]
You know and it's money in the churches the churches man.

[03:00:23:00]
My mom and dad don't take none of that money.

[03:00:24:11]
They don't even take a pay for preaching it.

[03:00:29:02]
They should get a double portion Bible says but he won't take one portion because he'd rather further along with the kingdom of God.

[03:00:36:08]
So I don't know where I was with all that.

[03:00:39:19]
I kind of lost myself.

[03:00:40:22]
That's fantastic.

[03:00:41:18]
What's your mom think about all this?

[03:00:43:13]
Mom she knows man it's a joke.

[03:00:46:08]
She's just like leave me out of it.

[03:00:48:09]
Leave me out of it.

[03:00:49:14]
Mom's a good hearted woman you know and she didn't want to be a part of it man.

[03:00:54:06]
You know she didn't want to she just she just loves the Lord.

[03:00:57:18]
She loves my dad she loves her children you know and she does what she's called to do.

[03:01:02:13]
And God has given her a calling you know and she writes dad's ministry messages down every day.

[03:01:07:12]
And you know she makes sure the house is taken care of and goes through things and makes sure nothing's wasted.

[03:01:12:18]
Waste not want not man.

[03:01:14:13]
And mom's always just had a really frugal sense of spirit of understanding and wisdom.

[03:01:20:05]
And she's just like hands off keep me out of the pictures keep me out of it.

[03:01:26:02]
You guys do stage stuff I'm not in it.

[03:01:28:19]
Y'all stay out keep it away from me.

[03:01:30:10]
[LAUGH]

[03:01:31:18]
She's hardcore and the best woman I ever met the tenderest heart you ever seen.

[03:01:35:19]
She's also not part of it leave me out of it.

[03:01:41:04]
She's the first one to go home with church too.

[03:01:42:13]
I don't want to have to deal with all of it.

[03:01:44:14]
All right I heard the message I'm here for Bob Pastor Bob gotta go.

[03:01:48:10]
I gotta go.

[03:01:49:10]
And I'm like where are you going Bob let's go.

[03:01:51:07]
[LAUGH]

[03:01:52:07]
I try to hit it out with her because they'll catch you man and that's all this thing.

[03:01:55:15]
But yeah just like church she does her call from the Lord.

[03:02:00:09]
And she's there to support her husband she's there to support her children.

[03:02:03:17]
And that's what she thinks about it.

[03:02:05:03]
Do they mind that all the people are showing up because of the conspiracy theory?

[03:02:08:09]
You what?

[03:02:08:21]
Do they mind that all the people are showing up on Sundays because of the No man I don't care why they're coming.

[03:02:14:20]
They're just preaching Jesus.

[03:02:16:20]
They're like man they want them to come.

[03:02:19:20]
Because people who got Jesus they already know.

[03:02:22:20]
Even if you ain't practicing or feeling it you already know the grace of God.

[03:02:28:20]
It's the people who don't know that they're after.

[03:02:32:19]
If one of them get hindered or one of them gets offended and leaves that's what they're worried about.

[03:02:36:19]
It's like let's love everybody.

[03:02:38:19]
There are some places where people get out of hand but it's a good church.

[03:02:43:05]
There's people come and they love each other and real protective spirits but they're not like push you away kind of protective spirits.

[03:02:49:12]
They're like hey everybody's accepted.

[03:02:50:19]
But if you're gonna get out of hand there's a handful of guys that will come up and make sure you're all right.

[03:02:55:18]
Do you need any help?

[03:02:56:20]
You guys okay?

[03:02:58:06]
So there's a lot of community spirit and efforts going on there.

[03:03:02:17]
And they want everybody to be there because that's how people get reached.

[03:03:07:14]
Love them.

[03:03:08:05]
I think one of the coolest things about the congregation is in particular those that aren't sure or do believe that your dad is Elvis.

[03:03:17:13]
I love the fact that in their belief they believe the man that had it all gave it all up for Christ.

[03:03:23:21]
And that to them makes them check their own spirituality.

[03:03:27:20]
Where are they in their walk?

[03:03:29:23]
Where are they?

[03:03:30:19]
Yeah.

[03:03:31:15]
I think that to me is one of the biggest takeaways of being involved in this project so far.

[03:03:35:23]
Well I think it's beautiful. because like no matter what's going on here the Lord is being shown.

[03:03:42:01]
So Jesus Jesus Jesus man.

[03:03:45:14]
My grandma that's all she said man.

[03:03:47:15]
Jesus Jesus Jesus.

[03:03:48:22]
She walked around in her old age.

[03:03:50:03]
Jesus Jesus Jesus.

[03:03:52:03]
And I think that she knew something.

[03:03:53:19]
Her wisdom was beyond all things.

[03:03:55:23]
I thought she was a little crazy myself.

[03:03:58:04]
I thought maybe she was like but she was really just intrepid on the fact that Jesus is her rock.

[03:04:03:21]
You know what I mean?

[03:04:04:17]
She just Jesus Jesus Jesus.

[03:04:06:01]
So man when my dad come out screaming spitting the gospel out it's a Pentecostal fiery preacher.

[03:04:11:07]
If you ain't seen it you ought to check him out.

[03:04:13:02]
Because like he come out screaming the same thing.

[03:04:15:12]
My grandma was Jesus Jesus Jesus.

[03:04:18:03]
But you know it's a funny thing that my mom learned about the grace of God before my dad did.

[03:04:23:00]
You know she understood grace and she understood she had to be you know graceful.

[03:04:28:09]
That she had to accept things that were coming down the line with love.

[03:04:32:23]
And that's the only way to change things that just be accepting and lovely.

[03:04:37:08]
Yeah so it's a wild thing that you know grandma's Jesus Jesus Jesus dad's screaming Jesus Jesus Jesus mama says grace of God and then dad comes grace of God.

[03:04:46:08]
And then all of a sudden the family and the household has changed.

[03:04:49:03]
And I remember the day my dad changed from this lawful preacher not that he was more love he was more but it wasn't totally graceful.

[03:04:59:22]
It was like he didn't David Coulter changed his world shook him up told him about the grace of God.

[03:05:05:21]
And we went to Alaska together me and my dad.

[03:05:08:08]
We went there I think we were gonna get a church to try to do then what we're doing now.

[03:05:14:19]
But it wasn't time.

[03:05:16:16]
You know we went up there saw everything beautiful all these beautiful things and dad goes into the woods.

[03:05:20:18]
And you know me and him didn't get along quite much.

[03:05:24:02]
You know and I'm a young man growing up full of rebellion and he didn't know quite how me and him was gonna figure this out.

[03:05:30:20]
And I think that going into the woods and he was praying I think he was praying for me at some point.

[03:05:35:16]
And I think the Lord just like hit him with the grace.

[03:05:41:02]
But my dad had changed.

[03:05:45:16]
And I am thankful because I didn't understand grace neither you know and it's still something that's a little touchy but it's like it's a tender touch now.

[03:06:02:15]
And it's a smell it's a taste it's a sweetness.

[03:06:07:15]
And my dad has it and to see it run through a family of brokenness voice of grace to God and the Holy Spirit that can keep us all together through it all our differences and that come from a father who loved the Lord. and a family and a grandmother and a mother that never stopped loving.

[03:06:36:09]
You know and that all comes from Jesus.

[03:06:38:09]
So you think that I think it's precious that Jesus is being shown?

[03:06:41:09]
Yes I do.

[03:06:42:11]
Yes I do.

[03:06:43:09]
And I don't care what anybody thinks and I don't care what anybody believes as long as they believe in Jesus.

[03:06:50:09]
And if you don't if you can get a little taste I thank you to change you because I don't think that I was looking to be changed.

[03:06:57:09]
I don't think I was looking.

[03:06:59:09]
I think that the Lord just found me where I was and I had a whole house full of love you know and of Jesus.

[03:07:05:09]
But it took me seeing the grace of God in my father for me to change years and years and years later you know so it's still changing.

[03:07:14:21]
It's still being changed.

[03:07:16:08]
Anyways yeah I'm thankful for it.

[03:07:19:08]
I definitely want to hear the story from him but you guys were going to Alaska to maybe plant a church.

[03:07:24:08]
Is that what you said?

[03:07:25:08]
bought a school bus man like a little raggedy school bus I don't even know how much they paid for it we're too young but like and it was all built up with beds in it you know so if the plan was is to get this thing running we were gonna take a cross country move to Alaska and build a church well in the meantime the guy who taught us about Alaska Randy Dotson he's passed away now but um his whole family lived there you know they and they'd moved down to Arkansas like right across the street from us which is where we did Bible studies for years and years and they were like you know told us all these stories about Alaska you know they're crazy wild stories about bears coming up licking a cigarette out of this guy's mouth I mean funny stories man but like and crazy wild stories are like no way is any of this stuff true no way is any of this stuff true and then you go to Alaska and you meet the people that tell you yes all this stuff's true they show you newspaper articles of this guy getting mauled by a bear and like all the details were in it and I'm like he told the truth then it made you wonder if he's telling truth about everything else up there.

[03:08:22:22]
You know so when we went up there I'm a gosh there is golden.

[03:08:25:13]
The river there is golden streams.

[03:08:28:02]
There is bears walking around everywhere.

[03:08:30:01]
There is salmon fish running upstream like crazy.

[03:08:33:07]
Like it it's like the Garden of Eden on Earth man.

[03:08:36:21]
And I think maybe maybe dad thought that you know and we drove up there and it was so beautiful.

[03:08:43:23]
And I don't know why we didn't do it.

[03:08:45:11]
You know I beg to stay.

[03:08:46:19]
You know we did the truck broke down on the way up.

[03:08:49:01]
And so dad had to get a job.

[03:08:52:00]
Well they don't have room for people to have jobs if you don't live there.

[03:08:55:13]
So this man was like hey he was gracious and kind to dad and picked him up for like $5 an hour.

[03:09:01:00]
So the amount of money we had to spend on a truck to get it fixed to get up there we probably should have just turned around and went home.

[03:09:06:22]
But he was determined to get there.

[03:09:09:05]
So we had to spend like an extra month there that we didn't plan on doing.

[03:09:12:10]
I was supposed to get back to go to school.

[03:09:13:19]
Well I had to go to school in Alaska man.

[03:09:16:15]
You know and when I went to school there they had all they had like different classes that you don't have around here.

[03:09:20:11]
And and the culture classes and a and Native American came in and you know and did a smoke thing and it was like showing us the nature things and rocks and the beautiful things but like really doing it though not like telling a class.

[03:09:32:22]
He was like Hey this is what we do in Alaska.

[03:09:35:09]
And it was just so beautiful.

[03:09:36:22]
Everything was so organic and nature-filled and beautiful.

[03:09:40:16]
And um I don't know why we didn't go but like I think the reason to go up there was for dad to have that moment with I don't know if that's when it changed but that's when I saw it.

[03:09:49:20]
And he was a different man.

[03:09:52:03]
But yeah we went to Alaska to get a church and then we came back and we stayed with Randy and their family they ended up moving back to Alaska.

[03:09:59:07]
And that's why we ended up going up there and we got a chance without a school bus.

[03:10:03:21]
So they were like hey just come stay with us in our apartment.

[03:10:06:18]
And we did and it was wonderful.

[03:10:08:18]
Then we came back home and then it wasn't time.

[03:10:14:02]
That's what dad said he's always saying it.

[03:10:15:19]
I'm always like how do you know what to do?

[03:10:19:09]
Like these people at church that go a little crazy sometimes and get off rocker.

[03:10:23:09]
I'm like how come you don't throw them out?

[03:10:24:22]
How come you don't deal with them?

[03:10:26:09]
And it's like son the Lord deals with people.

[03:10:29:05]
The Lord deals with the heart of man.

[03:10:30:22]
What am I going to do?

[03:10:32:08]
So it's always like a sit back and wait sit back and wait.

[03:10:35:20]
It's like be still and know that I'm God.

[03:10:37:15]
Dad's really good at doing that.

[03:10:40:11]
But he's a good teacher.

[03:10:43:08]
You had a good relationship with your dad?

[03:10:44:19]
Yeah man.

[03:10:45:13]
Yeah it wasn't great.

[03:10:47:06]
It wasn't great.

[03:10:50:19]
I was a fighter.

[03:10:51:19]
I had recklessness in me and I got myself around the wrong crowds and nobody could stop me from that and it got you into situations and trauma.

[03:11:03:09]
And so that trauma affected me and the people I was hanging out with affected me and everybody I knew was poor and we were all just trying to survive.

[03:11:12:06]
And we lived down the road from the park you know and the schools were over here.

[03:11:17:12]
And then you know this is where all the people came you know bent and segregated.

[03:11:21:08]
You know the tracks are down here and right down from the street from the park.

[03:11:26:14]
And and I lived on that street you know so where it was there was all kinds of people walking up and down between the tracks and the park and the schools.

[03:11:34:22]
And you know it was just like everything was happening right there.

[03:11:38:08]
And so it was a lot of fight you know so it got to a lot of fights and I don't I don't think anybody understood you know I was living in a different world.

[03:11:45:20]
You know mom and dad and them was going to church and they're keeping themselves you know unstained and I'm out there getting stained by the world you know.

[03:11:52:13]
So I don't think dad he was trying to figure out how to love me you know and if you spare the rod you spoil the child but also you hate your son if you don't discipline him.

[03:12:03:12]
You know so at some point man it's just disciplinary and thing just all dad was to me you know it's like all I could do is just like I was so mad at him all the time and he didn't understand me and I didn't understand him for sure you know and he was just so quiet and You know and it took a lot of years that's just like Figuring it out.

[03:12:21:17]
That's one went to Alaska together to see if we could you know gain a relationship and you know I just couldn't see a relationship with my dad.

[03:12:28:07]
He was nothing like me you know and he'd come to find out You know he's a lot like me you know you I'm a lot like my old man a lot like my mom You know I'm a lot like both of them.

[03:12:37:10]
So it's funny if you rebel against the thing that you are you start rebelling against your mom and dad.

[03:12:43:02]
But I think throughout the years going to college and having kids and having struggles and going into entertainment.

[03:12:52:00]
And my world's just a crazy world as it is.

[03:12:54:14]
I don't know what really made me as entertainer as I am but I thought maybe me singing would free up some conversation between me and dad.

[03:13:06:21]
He's a singer and I'm a singer.

[03:13:08:21]
You know he was he's just always like I always thought he was just so much better than me.

[03:13:13:06]
You know dad's always so much better than me.

[03:13:15:01]
And I just couldn't I think I was mad at him.

[03:13:18:01]
You know I think that I was just mad at him for not knowing who I was and being better than me you know and I realized I mean that's just comparison's just crazy anyway.

[03:13:28:23]
You know you ain't supposed to compare yourself to people who's demonic you know?

[03:13:32:04]
Nobody's like you nobody's like me.

[03:13:34:17]
Nobody's like him.

[03:13:35:18]
Nobody's like anybody you know?

[03:13:37:15]
But we're all kind of like the same.

[03:13:39:10]
You know we all have the same broken spirits influences.

[03:13:44:10]
Some of us got the same love.

[03:13:46:02]
Some of us got the same talents but we're all individual and unique.

[03:13:49:05]
And I think I just didn't know who I was you know and a lot of that relationship that was bad was me you know and I think some of it was you know my dad didn't have a dad growing up you know he didn't have no dad.

[03:14:01:04]
He was a young man his dad passed away.

[03:14:03:18]
And I don't think he knew what to say to his son you know But then as grace leads on and that change came in dad was always throwing little tender things moments of sweetness.

[03:14:14:21]
And it's just it changed me.

[03:14:17:20]
But like so as that started to grow then we had a real relationship.

[03:14:21:00]
It's like wow I would do it all over again and have and do it all over again to have the relationship I have with my father.

[03:14:27:13]
I love him to death.

[03:14:28:23]
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

[03:14:30:07]
There's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

[03:14:32:03]
There's nothing this family wouldn't do for each other.

[03:14:34:14]
So like that I don't know man.

[03:14:36:21]
I see a lot of dads out there and everybody's always like "Well you know he's not a good dad.

[03:14:41:04]
Nobody's a good dad.

[03:14:42:00]
This guy ain't a good dad."

[03:14:42:18]
Who's a good dad?

[03:14:44:17]
Who's a good dad except the Father in heaven man?

[03:14:47:01]
So we're gonna look at each other like that.

[03:14:49:08]
I started looking at him one day like he's my brother in Christ Warren.

[03:14:53:01]
Yes he's my father but I have a father.

[03:14:55:09]
My heavenly father.

[03:14:56:16]
Say he's my dad.

[03:14:58:04]
So it's like what a joy.

[03:15:02:10]
What a happy moment.

[03:15:03:08]
I got a dad.

[03:15:04:11]
I don't have a father.

[03:15:05:14]
I have a father he loves me.

[03:15:07:06]
I got a dad that's like a joyful happy thing.

[03:15:09:09]
It's like soup.

[03:15:10:20]
It's like I love my dad.

[03:15:12:16]
We have a great relationship and I love you dad.

[03:15:15:08]
Couple last questions for you from my end.

[03:15:19:04]
You said your middle name's Charro.

[03:15:23:12]
Charro.

[03:15:24:09]
How did you get that?

[03:15:25:10]
That's the Elvis movie Charro.

[03:15:26:18]
Are you serious?

[03:15:27:14]
Oh yeah man dad named me after the Elvis movie.

[03:15:29:19]
He loved the name and Charro.

[03:15:33:07]
That's not even the name of Elvis in the movie.

[03:15:35:04]
It was Wade whatever but like Charo is the name of the movie.

[03:15:39:14]
So Amy Charo Matthew Charo.

[03:15:41:19]
You didn't know who Elvis was but you were sharing the middle name of a movie that Elvis was in.

[03:15:45:06]
Yeah I didn't know.

[03:15:46:20]
Growing up I didn't know.

[03:15:48:04]
I can tell you honestly I thought my whoever sang Kentucky Rain was my dad right?

[03:15:56:13]
Because I remember my dad being I don't know I was probably I can't remember how old I was.

[03:16:02:01]
I was singing at a junior high maybe middle school.

[03:16:06:12]
Anyway I think it was middle school but I was singing "Katucky Rain."

[03:16:08:13]
I was like "I'm gonna sing that song 'cause dad was singing "Katucky Rain."

[03:16:11:19]
We were doing a festival and he had just recorded his album you know in the '80s and we were going to I can't remember where we were at.

[03:16:22:04]
Anyways he was singing "Katucky Rain" in his thing man and I was like "Man I love that song."

[03:16:26:11]
And I was like "It's my dad."

[03:16:27:15]
Of course it's my dad you know?

[03:16:29:08]
And then he's saying um the American trilogy but it was like with different words it was like uh or you know your baby is going to die.

[03:16:38:07]
It was the thing you know with enlightenment on abortion or some kind of issues stuff that the people were like so they changed the words to the song and and so he sang it.

[03:16:46:02]
So I didn't know that that was a change of words of the song.

[03:16:49:01]
I just knew that that was the song.

[03:16:51:00]
Right.

[03:16:51:19]
You know so Kentucky rain Kentucky rain he's falling down.

[03:16:56:00]
You think about Kentucky Rain you hear it sang by your dad.

[03:16:58:22]
It sounds like the man who recorded it.

[03:17:00:17]
It's like that's the man who recorded it.

[03:17:03:05]
I'm in the studio with him.

[03:17:04:07]
He's recording the Kentucky rain.

[03:17:06:08]
You know what I mean?

[03:17:07:02]
So it was kind of funny.

[03:17:08:03]
You know I didn't know who Elvis even was you know all of a sudden this guy's Oh Elvis recorded Kentucky rain.

[03:17:15:09]
Not my dad.

[03:17:16:13]
My dad was just doing it for that festival.

[03:17:18:08]
You know so it was a strange moment when I when I realized there was a guy named Elvis and we're sitting there watching him on TV.

[03:17:24:15]
I'm like Elvis who's Elvis?

[03:17:26:18]
Because that guy sounds like you you know what I mean?

[03:17:29:07]
So we weren't raised with it and nobody thought it.

[03:17:32:01]
But you get a little older once he was singing now then once it all came out that this guy sounds like Elvis.

[03:17:37:10]
I'm like oh Elvis an Elvis guy.

[03:17:39:10]
I remember doing this we were at this festival and he'd come out singing "Can't Help Falling in Love."

[03:17:45:17]
And people thought it was just a recording.

[03:17:49:18]
And then dad walked out as he was singing and on stage and just people just went crazy because like it just sounds so close.

[03:17:55:14]
I'm like ah that's that's the Elvis guy that you're talking about.

[03:17:58:12]
People are like Hey he sounds like Elvis.

[03:18:00:06]
Oh so to me it started to come together.

[03:18:02:11]
It was this guy named Elvis.

[03:18:03:11]
And I seen him on TV with dad and I'm like that's Elvis.

[03:18:06:16]
You know so that's that was my understanding in Charo.

[03:18:09:13]
I didn't even know it was a movie an Elvis movie sometime between there and me doing Elvis I learned it but like I didn't know that there was an Elvis.

[03:18:17:22]
I never watched the movie you know until I become an Elvis tribute artist.

[03:18:21:07]
And I'm like I had to watch it all.

[03:18:22:18]
He learned all of it and I'm like yeah.

[03:18:25:00]
Have you and your dad ever talked about him being a fan of Elvis?

[03:18:29:10]
Yeah yeah I was like Dad you must have liked Elvis you sound like him.

[03:18:33:22]
It's like yeah boy I grew up with him definitely Elvis fan.

[03:18:37:08]
They all yeah they did say that but he didn't talk a whole bunch about it.

[03:18:43:12]
They ain't like Dad ain't a man of many words as it is.

[03:18:46:19]
He said yeah son I like Elvis.

[03:18:49:06]
Hey Dad it's going all right.

[03:18:50:16]
Yes sir.

[03:18:51:08]
[LAUGH]

[03:18:52:13]
What'd you do yesterday that way?

[03:18:53:20]
I'm just gonna leave a couple things around the house.

[03:18:56:18]
They don't talk a whole lot about nothing.

[03:18:58:08]
So it's like yeah he's the Elvis fan.

[03:19:00:03]
Of course he is.

[03:19:01:17]
In his age who wasn't?

[03:19:03:00]
You know what I mean?

[03:19:03:22]
Nobody wasn't an Elvis fan except the older people who didn't like him.

[03:19:07:14]
Shaking and stuff dry raking hips.

[03:19:09:18]
How'd you get to the bench?

[03:19:12:18]
You what?

[03:19:13:07]
Why'd you guys move to the bench?

[03:19:14:17]
I think of my aunt.

[03:19:23:03]
I think my aunt moved here.

[03:19:24:17]
You know I don't really know.

[03:19:28:17]
You know I know when we were little bitty you know dad was out evangelizing across country and preaching you know and some mom was home with the kids and they would go out and then they would come back you know.

[03:19:40:16]
I think my aunt she's also a preacher.

[03:19:45:16]
She's also a preacher woman.

[03:19:47:16]
I think she found a church out here a house and she was wanting to start a church.

[03:19:50:16]
And I think dad came up to back her up.

[03:19:52:16]
But I'm not real certain.

[03:19:54:16]
Because I mean I was three.

[03:19:55:16]
I was three years old.

[03:19:56:16]
Last question from me and I'm sure Brian had a couple.

[03:19:59:16]
One of the things that's helped sort of feed this conspiracy theory is we struggle to find pictures of you of your dad younger?

[03:20:10:16]
Do you have pictures of your dad younger?

[03:20:15:04]
Were there any around the house or is it just not like--  Well there's pictures of dad out there man.

[03:20:19:11]
But I'll tell you this personally they don't look like him.

[03:20:23:09]
They just don't look like the same dad that he is now.

[03:20:25:11]
But like man you can watch you can see pictures of him when he's a younger man.

[03:20:31:16]
Like I say younger man.

[03:20:33:13]
Like when I was little seven or eight You could tell he's the same guy from then to here but he still looks different from there there.

[03:20:40:18]
You know what I mean?

[03:20:41:13]
He he is the same man.

[03:20:42:23]
I know his character but like he he was just a different looking person.

[03:20:46:23]
I mean he's a better looking man.

[03:20:48:09]
You know as he got older he got better looking better looking better looking better looking better looking.

[03:20:52:01]
Now he's like Sean Connery meets what's his name.

[03:20:54:18]
You know what I mean?

[03:20:55:05]
Like all you know meets Elvis you know what I mean?

[03:20:57:06]
But he looked he's just a better looking man.

[03:20:59:20]
And when he's young he wouldn't he doesn't even look like the same person.

[03:21:02:15]
He really doesn't even look like the same person.

[03:21:04:15]
He looks a little bit like Tom but they look totally different even.

[03:21:09:04]
But Tom's got the most similarities of my father than any of us.

[03:21:13:12]
My last question before Brian asks you anything let me ask you the most ridiculous one.

[03:21:18:08]
If you find out your dad's Elvis how would you react?

[03:21:21:05]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[03:21:24:06]
I don't know I'd probably hit him in the face.

[03:21:26:18]
We'll give him one whacking.

[03:21:28:13]
I wouldn't hit my dad that's against my belief system but I would want to.

[03:21:32:11]
I'll tell you what if it came out that dad's Elvis me and him be wrestling.

[03:21:37:19]
There'll be a lot of things and I'll be in Graceland real quick.

[03:21:40:11]
I'll be on my to do list is recording a jungle room.

[03:21:44:04]
So yeah I'd be a little upset.

[03:21:46:17]
Grew up pretty poor be a hard thing to swallow.

[03:21:49:22]
[LAUGH]

[03:21:52:18]
Brian what do you got?

[03:21:53:14]
So good.

[03:21:55:09]
One of the things that someone told us Matt is that your dad has the ability to You can throw any Elvis song at him and he can go play on guitar or piano.

[03:22:03:20]
Is that true?

[03:22:04:09]
I think so.

[03:22:08:02]
I don't know the 100 I had to feed him the words to the America trilogy.

[03:22:13:02]
You know what I mean?

[03:22:13:12]
So what he had came up with him maybe.

[03:22:16:01]
That's a pretty number one Elvis song right?

[03:22:21:02]
So he didn't know all the words to that but did he?

[03:22:25:10]
Did he know tell her Jim said hello?

[03:22:28:23]
Yeah he did and that's weird.

[03:22:32:02]
We didn't ever listen to that growing up.

[03:22:34:04]
Strange.

[03:22:34:23]
Did he listen to it growing up?

[03:22:36:11]
Was I not around all of his growing up years?

[03:22:38:17]
Yes I was not around all of his growing up years.

[03:22:41:07]
Did he listen to Elvis?

[03:22:42:13]
I mean I don't know.

[03:22:46:08]
I don't know.

[03:22:46:20]
He didn't talk about it.

[03:22:47:16]
You know what I mean?

[03:22:48:03]
It's like did their family household listen to Elvis?

[03:22:50:05]
I wouldn't think so because of Maul my grandma Maul we called her Maul.

[03:22:54:04]
I don't think she listened to any music.

[03:22:56:04]
So how does dad know all the Elvis tunes?

[03:22:58:18]
Strange one to me too but I don't think he's Elvis.

[03:23:01:14]
Now he does know a lot of those songs and can play them.

[03:23:05:23]
You know but he also has an amazing ear.

[03:23:08:07]
You can throw anything at my father and he can play it.

[03:23:10:18]
You know I write songs with different tempo changes that it's hard for people to follow unless you know the song they can follow it.

[03:23:17:06]
So amazing musician yes he is.

[03:23:20:01]
Did Elvis write songs?

[03:23:21:21]
Nope did dad?

[03:23:23:18]
Never one of them every one of them.

[03:23:25:20]
You know so if you're looking for something You know maybe it was a hidden talent that Elvis had and he was just being held back by Colonel Parker.

[03:23:32:05]
Because he was held back pretty much everything he did.

[03:23:35:05]
Fed drugs until he couldn't think anymore and sang the same stupid songs until he died.

[03:23:40:05]
You know that sucks.

[03:23:42:05]
Was he being held back?

[03:23:44:05]
He's being held back.

[03:23:45:05]
Is he dad?

[03:23:47:05]
If he is boy.

[03:23:49:05]
I'm just kidding.

[03:23:50:05]
But yeah I mean it's strange that dad knows all his songs.

[03:23:53:05]
I don't think if you put him down a list he would know every one of them.

[03:23:57:04]
[ Inaudible ]

[03:24:18:04]
I'm not going to talk about my mom on here anymore.

[03:24:20:14]

[03:24:24:02]
So when it comes to --  No I'm not gonna talk about it.

[03:24:27:16]
Beside that I did see the picture and it's strange how much they look like but I know what my mom looked like.
