[14:51:56:08]
Great.

[14:52:01:08]
Hold that slate up for us.

[14:52:06:08]
Kevin Chandler.

[14:52:11:08]
That's a wrap.

[14:52:12:08]
Good job Kevin.

[14:52:14:08]
Got worked up about nothing.

[14:52:19:08]
Kevin where do you live and how long have you been attending church?

[14:52:23:08]
I live in Bryant Arkansas.

[14:52:25:13]
I've been going to Household of Faith for Mother's Day will be one year so it's a little over a year.

[14:52:32:10]
How'd you first hear about Household of Faith?

[14:52:35:09]
I was not even looking for a church.

[14:52:37:13]
I wasn't looking for really anything just scrolling on social media.

[14:52:41:10]
Something came across about Elvis is alive in Arkansas.

[14:52:46:17]
Of course since I live in Arkansas I wanna see what's going on.

[14:52:49:15]
I just kept scrolling and it came up a video It said Benton Arkansas.

[14:52:54:17]
Or not Arkansas I didn't see the Arkansas I just saw Benton and I thought okay it's Benton Texas or something it's not even coming here.

[14:53:00:23]
And then I saw Arkansas and I was like this is eight minutes from down the road from my house.

[14:53:06:07]
I told my boss I said I'm going to church this Sunday.

[14:53:09:22]
I went to church I was nervous.

[14:53:14:15]
I thought this little bitty church is gonna see this stranger walk in and they're immediately gonna go you we know you don't belong here you're out.

[14:53:22:20]
And it was the furthest thing from that.

[14:53:26:11]
Everybody was just "How are you doing?"

[14:53:28:12]
First time shaking my hand "Love you brother."

[14:53:31:06]
And I'm like "These people don't know me but they're acting like we're family already."

[14:53:34:22]
And I left that church that day and the proverbial weight on your shoulders was gone.

[14:53:42:10]
Everything was brighter.

[14:53:44:12]
I could think better.

[14:53:46:01]
My mind felt clearer.

[14:53:48:07]
And I was like "This is how life is supposed to be.

[14:53:51:00]
It's supposed to be this way.

[14:53:52:23]
I was living it totally wrong all this time.

[14:53:56:09]
And I've been back every Sunday and I love it.

[14:54:00:04]
It is we can't go fast enough to get back to church.

[14:54:04:08]
Were you actively going to church prior to that?

[14:54:08:06]
I had not been to church in probably 20 plus years.

[14:54:12:17]
Just I thought not that I was smarter than God or Jesus.

[14:54:17:17]
I just thought I'll have my conversation with Jesus on the way to work or way home.

[14:54:22:17]
And that's how it's supposed to be.

[14:54:24:09]
But I walked into that church and I was like nope that's not how life is.

[14:54:29:16]
This is how life is supposed to be.

[14:54:32:05]
So you originally went obviously because of the online theories.

[14:54:37:08]
Yes.

[14:54:38:05]
You met the man over his first depression.

[14:54:41:05]
Oh my gosh.

[14:54:42:08]
I couldn't even hardly talk.

[14:54:45:14]
I just shook his hand and was just nervous 'cause I was still kind of you know I know why you're here but he didn't say nothing like that Bob.

[14:54:54:05]
Just comes up shakes your hand good to have you and I mean he listens he looks at you.

[14:55:01:01]
It's almost like he's staring into your soul and knows what you're about but he's such a good guy and you're so comfortable around him and I just can't wait to shake his hand in the morning say good morning brother I love you after church shake his hands brother oh it's such an awesome testimony and preaching today and it's it's just the best feeling in the world I believe it's the congregation the people.

[14:55:47:15]
You don't just come in here.

[14:55:49:15]
The last church I was a member of you walked in you shook somebody's hand you went and sat down.

[14:55:53:15]
And that's what you did until the preacher started preaching and you started singing.

[14:55:57:15]
It's family.

[14:55:59:15]
When you say church family this is a family because everyone how was your surgery?

[14:56:04:15]
How was your kids after their baseball or their soccer?

[14:56:08:15]
And it's just the warmest feeling.

[14:56:13:03]
And Bob it's something I can't put my finger on.

[14:56:17:03]
It's just he is blessed by God to preach and sing.

[14:56:21:05]
And it makes it exciting.

[14:56:24:17]
Do you still think about this year as an E Elvis when you're there?

[14:56:31:05]
Honestly it crosses my mind at least once every time I'm there at least once.

[14:56:36:14]
And there's just things he'll say.

[14:56:39:12]
You'll hear a little saying.

[14:56:41:13]
The other day something happened and he said "Thank you thank you very much."

[14:56:46:02]
And I looked at Phil and said "He did it he said it."

[14:56:49:06]
And it's like that I'll stand there next to Phil and every time I'll see someone Bob will throw out I'll all shook up or something.

[14:56:57:04]
And I'm like "He's doing it man he's doing it."

[14:57:00:07]
What is sort of the like Why is there sort of like a hundred people with no one ever approaching him about it?

[14:57:09:12]
I don't really know.

[14:57:13:10]
It's almost like you know I hear people say "Why?"

[14:57:16:02]
When I go I'll ask him I'll tell him.

[14:57:17:15]
But I think once you're there there's like just a respect that comes over you that you're like especially after you've heard him preach that if people do walk up to him and say stuff I don't hear them say it.

[14:57:32:03]
It's almost like a spiritual thing that I don't care that he's Elvis.

[14:57:38:02]
He's Bob Joyce and I love Bob Joyce.

[14:57:41:09]
I think that once you hear him preach the Elvis thing goes away.

[14:57:45:12]
Tell me about you said you were a little worried coming into the safety of the way is that?

[14:57:50:16]
Cuz I didn't wanna smear Bob.

[14:57:53:02]
I didn't wanna hurt his feelings.

[14:57:55:09]
Not like I go out to dinner with him all the time or hang out with him.

[14:58:00:06]
You know it was mainly a church and I didn't want to be that person that was trying to be a friend to him and then turn around and stab him in the back.

[14:58:10:05]
I love the respect of everybody I have at the church.

[14:58:14:05]
And after finally finding a church to go to it would devastate me to be told "Hey we just don't really want you coming around here no more."

[14:58:23:05]
And you brought him with you for the church?

[14:58:25:05]
I've actually brought my son a couple of times.

[14:58:29:05]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[14:58:39:05]
and turned around and got him me and his mother been divorced for 27 years and I actually got her to come and her husband and her dad to come.

[14:58:41:00]
So it's and my cousin has also came I got her to come.

[14:58:45:12]
More people knew about Bob before I knew where Bob was.

[14:58:49:03]
And then when I bring his name up they're like "Oh you go to that church."

[14:58:52:20]
And I'm like "Well I go to that church "and y'all need to come to that church."

[14:58:56:22]
Yeah so people around Everyone seems to be from all over the place.

[14:59:02:21]
And yet it's not the church in Daniel Arkansas.

[14:59:07:14]
It is not by far the church.

[14:59:11:01]
There's so many churches in Saline County and I guess in Arkansas.

[14:59:14:20]
And there are a lot of people I run into and say "Hey you ever heard of Bob Joyce?"

[14:59:19:13]
And they're "No."

[14:59:20:09]
But then there's other people you say "Bob Joyce?"

[14:59:22:11]
And they go "Oh you go to church with Bob Joyce."

[14:59:27:04]
And it's just it's weird to see different reactions you get.

[14:59:31:04]
And the first question is is he Elvis?

[14:59:36:04]
I'm just like man my opinion I believe he is.

[14:59:39:17]
But after about the third or fourth time I don't care.

[14:59:45:11]
He could tell me right now he's Elvis or was Elvis.

[14:59:48:09]
I wouldn't care.

[14:59:49:15]
I'd say you're Bob Joyce to me and that's what you're going to say.

[14:59:53:14]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[15:00:03:14]
I feel like I wasn't an angry person.

[15:00:20:20]
But I guess an introvert is what I want to say.

[15:00:25:00]
I really didn't want to be bothered.

[15:00:27:16]
Just stayed to myself.

[15:00:30:02]
And me and Gary were talking about it earlier.

[15:00:32:19]
I said Gary the church is slowly making me come out of my shell.

[15:00:38:01]
And I'm able to just walk up and talk to people.

[15:00:42:02]
I may not have a big conversation with them but I'm like hey who are you?

[15:00:47:03]
First time.

[15:00:48:00]
I can do it at a grocery store just talking to somebody.

[15:00:52:01]
It is it's every I think every Sunday I'm being a better and better person you know treating people better try to understand that we all have our problems we all have stresses and try not to take take out what's going on in my life on somebody else because they had nothing to do with it and just be more positive.

[15:01:16:04]
Obviously as you mentioned a lot of people come to the church with that question "Could this be Elvis?"

[15:01:24:04]
Is there any fear that you have that more people are going to come the church is going to get too big you're going to lose that sense of community you have?

[15:01:32:03]
I did it first and then almost immediately after starting there they started talking about looking for more property and another place to build.

[15:01:43:03]
I actually just was honest with people and said "I really selfishly don't want the church bigger.

[15:01:50:02]
I like this small country family church but it's not about me it's about what God wants.

[15:01:56:07]
If a bigger church is what we're supposed to have then we'll deal with it and we can handle it."

[15:02:02:19]
I tell everybody we're fixing to explode.

[15:02:06:06]
After we had the big thing in Hot Springs the convention center I just feel like our Our new church is not going to be built big enough.

[15:02:14:02]
We're going to have to build another church.

[15:02:16:02]
Last question for me what did your son think of the church he attended?

[15:02:25:00]
I think he's still skeptical.

[15:02:27:00]
I don't know I need to ask him if he's looked.

[15:02:30:12]
He comes to a lot of our lunches after church.

[15:02:33:19]
Or not a lot he's been to a few of them.

[15:02:35:17]
Him and Matt stand and talk for a while.

[15:02:37:17]
But I do believe he feels good that his dad has finally got back into church.

[15:02:45:17]
Because he's always went with his mom and her side.

[15:02:49:00]
And he's asked me about going and he said dad the third time he goes well you're just going because you think he's Elvis.

[15:02:57:21]
I said but he got me into church and I've been ever since.

[15:03:01:11]
And I think he just loves hearing me go hey I'm going to a lunch this weekend for church or you know I came here for church you know this album release went to the convention center on that weekend so I think he's just loving that his dad is finally got closer to Jesus.

[15:03:19:14]
Which thing do you think the album released for you?

[15:03:22:14]
I've never been to one and thought it was the best thing that I one of the best things I've ever been to just just to see all the people come around it was almost like a church again really because everywhere I looked there was people I've seen in church and went to church with and I told somebody last night I said you know one time when I was a kid growing up I wanted to go to like one of my favorite rappers or rock bands album release and I'm like I'm glad I never got that dream this is the dream I wanted to go to this Bob Joyce album release is probably the best thing  That's fantastic.

[15:04:01:01]
That's great.

[15:04:02:01]
All right you nailed it.

[15:04:04:01]
Well.

[15:04:05:13]
You did great.

[15:04:08:01]
I'm excited man.

[15:04:09:01]
This is maybe I should have said it in the camera but I just this is not things that I would have done before the church.

[15:04:18:18]
Just coming to Nashville or Franklin I don't travel.

[15:04:22:17]
I'm not a traveler.

[15:04:23:17]
I'm 54 I live in Arkansas.

[15:04:26:05]
That's all I wanna be is in Arkansas.

[15:04:28:22]
Every time I hear him say "We're gonna do this in Hodgepah I'm there.

[15:04:31:22]
"Hey we're going oh okay we're going to Franklin."

[15:04:34:22]
Man I'm loving this stuff.

[15:04:36:22]
This has changed me you know?

[15:04:38:22]
And I'm not a...

[15:04:40:22]
Like if I hadn't been for church I'd walk right past these people out here and just go...

[15:04:47:22]
I'm gonna go out there and shake their hands hug them tell them I love them and see you next Sunday and live on.

[15:04:53:22]
I love it.

[15:04:54:21]
It's y'all guys need to move closer [laughter]

[15:05:01:23]
Awesome.

[15:05:03:23]
Nice to meet you.
