Alright go ahead with the slate Brian.

[14:30:28:02]
Good.

[14:30:30:02]
Hold that.

[14:30:32:02]
Alright.

[14:30:34:02]
Give us the name and give us the...

[14:30:36:02]
I'll do that.

[14:30:38:02]
My name is Carlos Arrowood.

[14:30:42:02]
I live in Benton Arkansas.

[14:30:44:01]
I've lived here since 1963.

[14:30:48:01]
Great.

[14:30:54:01]
Brian you settle.

[14:30:56:01]
You'll be answering right in the lens if that's okay.

[14:30:58:01]
Alright so give me that again.

[14:31:04:09]
Tell me your name where you live.

[14:31:06:21]
My name is Carlos Arrowood.

[14:31:08:21]
I moved to Benton in 1963.

[14:31:11:18]
Went in the Navy in '64 '66.

[14:31:17:01]
Got out in '70.

[14:31:20:05]
Moved to California in '77.

[14:31:24:10]
Moved back here in '97.

[14:31:27:11]
I was driving a concrete truck and I worked with a guy that His mother was going to this church called Household of Faith and he invited me to church.

[14:31:48:18]
That was in 1998.

[14:31:53:11]
So I went to this church and I felt like we had a lot of what am I trying to say we could win a lot of souls where we were located.

[14:32:11:19]
And so I had no idea that Brother Bob was there at that church but he was the preacher there.

[14:32:26:00]
He wasn't the pastor he was the preacher.

[14:32:28:14]
And so when I was a little boy going to church he reminded me of the preacher back when I was seven eight years old and I liked his preaching.

[14:32:41:09]
So I left that church and I told him if he ever started a ministry I'd support him.

[14:32:48:00]
And so he came by my house and he said I'm about to ready to start a ministry and I said well it's about time.

[14:32:57:10]
And so here we are we started this church in 2014 and there was 14 of us.

[14:33:07:09]
And now look at us now.

[14:33:08:10]
I mean we're reaching souls out there.

[14:33:11:15]
It's unbelievable how people come there and they'll think one thing and they get out of church and they'll say "Well do you think he's so-and-so?"

[14:33:26:02]
And I say "Well let me tell you like this."

[14:33:29:10]
I said "If the man is so-and-so and he gave up all of that worldly stuff preach the word like he does praise God then I would support him you know I would support him.

[14:33:50:17]
So when we moved into this church we're at right now I told him that the place wasn't going to be big enough.

[14:33:58:18]
And so the next church that we're fixing to refurbish and everything it's still not going be big enough.

[14:34:08:18]
This man is going to reach souls out there that's unbelievable.

[14:34:12:23]
He is a true word of God.

[14:34:17:02]
He is full of the Spirit.

[14:34:21:11]
I mean you know even when he's driving down the street I've known him since 1998-99 when he's driving down the street and I'll be standing out there with my campaign signs he will ignore me.

[14:34:41:21]
He won't even know that I'm there but he's praising the Lord driving down the street.

[14:34:47:00]
I love him and he'll love his family.

[14:34:53:20]
I don't know what else to say about the man.

[14:34:59:22]
He sings till he gets in the spirit and he goes to preaching.

[14:35:06:03]
I've never seen him do anything that I didn't like.

[14:35:13:00]
He's just a man of God.

[14:35:16:04]
But people like I say do you think he's so and so?

[14:35:20:21]
If he gives up all of that to preach the word then I will support him.

[14:35:26:13]
[ Inaudible ]

[14:35:44:18]
Well I never was an Elvis fan.

[14:35:48:01]
I liked his gospel music but I never even thought about that when I first heard him sing.

[14:35:56:10]
The first thing I thought about I said "Well the man can sing good."

[14:35:59:10]
But I never associated him with Elvis.

[14:36:04:22]
But you know God says you know that everybody's got a twin.

[14:36:11:17]
So that might be his twin.

[14:36:14:07]
Now I know another man that had known him before I knew him.

[14:36:21:12]
He used to help build houses and add on rooms and do remodeling and stuff.

[14:36:32:09]
He built my garage for my car.

[14:36:35:19]
My brother Pastor Bob built my garage and built my shop.

[14:36:42:04]
And he's a great carpenter.

[14:36:43:20]
I mean people come here thinking one thing like I say and they like his preaching.

[14:36:53:07]
Well I come here for the other thing but I like his preaching now.

[14:36:57:16]
So here we are praising.

[14:36:59:20]
Have you ever talked to him about this Elvis?

[14:37:03:13]
No I wouldn't.

[14:37:04:10]
I would never that's none of my business.

[14:37:08:02]
That's you know I don't I would never I would never confront him with that.

[14:37:15:22]
We don't talk a whole lot together.

[14:37:18:08]
We I know this he's a busy person.

[14:37:21:13]
He's got all this Internet stuff going on and so I don't.

[14:37:27:08]
I don't call him and I think he's a personal friend of mine.

[14:37:31:02]
I don't think I know he is.

[14:37:34:00]
But you know I've never I've never thought of him as Elvis.

[14:37:40:04]
You know.

[14:37:40:19]
They're just.

[14:37:45:04]
There's comparison there but you know like I say if let Let him preach the word and and let Elvis die You know that's the way I look at it.

[14:38:00:15]
I Don't know Like I say there's another man that knows him better than I do probably That I told Steve about him.

[14:38:13:09]
I wish we could have got him up here and he could probably told you more than I do You know but I don't know that I'm just praying for his health and and that he will have have an opportunity to finish up what work God has given him and So we're going to reach thousands and thousands of people out there I want to thank John Cook for putting this all on the internet and getting this started so maybe something great will come out of this.

[14:38:57:02]
People are hungry for the Word they're hungry for the true Word of God and Brother Bob has got that.

[14:39:03:19]
He preaches Jesus and that's all we need in our life is Jesus.

[14:39:09:09]
I mean he was he was the one that started the Internet you know putting it on the Internet streaming streaming.

[14:39:20:20]
Yes.

[14:39:21:08]
And so.

[14:39:23:21]
It's amazing.

[14:39:26:09]
I mean you know people come here like brother Steve.

[14:39:30:08]
He'd been coming.

[14:39:31:08]
He drives over here.

[14:39:32:08]
Amazing.

[14:39:32:22]
It's 50 something times 60 times. times I don't know you know but I wish I had enough stamina to do that you know there's another lady I'm sure that she's 80 something years old and she drives from Mississippi over here you know pretty much every Sunday you know and she's only missed maybe a dozen Sundays in six years five six years you know It's just amazing people.

[14:40:04:16]
Brother Bob loves people.

[14:40:05:23]
I mean you know he he he's he's easy to talk to you know first and foremost he's full of he's full of the Lord.

[14:40:20:15]
I mean you know he just he's I'm just thankful I met him and got to know him and you know I didn't go to church from the time I was probably 18 years old until 1998 and so but he got me back into church you know and so you do the question I didn't run out of answers.

[14:40:56:10]
Talk about the congregation the people around Bob.

[14:41:01:09]
The people around Bob?

[14:41:02:20]
Well I pray for them that they will do the right thing and keep the word going keep his ministry going.

[14:41:11:18]
I just don't want anybody persuading him in any direction.

[14:41:19:15]
I want him to be the driver of his ministry.

[14:41:24:05]
And so if he does that we've got a winner.

[14:41:28:09]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[14:41:31:09]
Carlos do you think it's a good thing that people compare Pastor Bob to Elvis or is it a bad thing?

[14:41:37:05]
I don't think either way.

[14:41:39:16]
I mean if it brings people in if the music brings the people in then he can preach to them and that way he will change their mind the way they're thinking.

[14:41:55:01]
There's a lot of Satan going on around here.

[14:41:58:01]
You know it's a and if people don't wake up and start following the Lord we're in some terrible times right now.

[14:42:08:01]
And I'm just thankful that Brother Bob has got this ministry going and that we could reach people out here that will maybe change their mind. mind.

[14:42:19:01]
I mean you know one time I think I'd heard that we had changed 12 people's minds that they were getting ready to commit suicide and after listening to Brother Bob preach they changed their mind.

[14:42:34:17]
So you know that's positive stuff right there.

[14:42:42:04]
You know I just pray for his health and that he will people continue preaching the word and bringing people in and they need to know the truth.

[14:42:58:17]
People are hungry for the truth.

[14:43:00:20]
There are so many preachers out there right now that are preaching the gospel.

[14:43:07:01]
He's not in it for the money.

[14:43:09:18]
He doesn't care about the money.

[14:43:13:12]
He lives in a modest home and he drives a modest car.

[14:43:18:07]
Money don't do nothing for him.

[14:43:21:11]
Jesus is what does the stuff for him.

[14:43:26:22]
We've had people come up there and offer him all kinds of stuff to go preach at their church and he turns them down because he wants to preach his message.

[14:43:42:10]
Money is the CDs that he makes.

[14:43:47:01]
It all goes back into the church.

[14:43:54:04]
When we first started the church I gave him a little check.

[14:43:58:00]
It was a small one.

[14:43:59:00]
It wasn't much.

[14:44:00:00]
He said "You don't have to do that."

[14:44:01:00]
I said "Be quiet.

[14:44:02:00]
I'll give you a little bit of money to get this thing going.

[14:44:06:20]
We've got to pay the light bill and the rent."

[14:44:08:09]
He's not in it for the money.

[14:44:18:07]
Some people might think he is but he's not.

[14:44:20:11]
I know the man.

[14:44:21:11]
I know him. know him.

[14:44:42:06]
I don't know what else to say about the man.

[14:44:43:22]
I mean you know he just He's a true Christian.

[14:44:49:22]
And if he was Elvis Presley and he gave up all that stuff to preach the word man I couldn't do it.

[14:44:58:22]
Hey I've tried.

[14:44:59:22]
I mean hey I've got a bad side on me.

[14:45:02:22]
And I've got one thing that I'm struggling with now that I mean you know it's been trouble you know?

[14:45:07:22]
I mean so I know-- but I wish I could do half of what he's of what he's done I'd be a better person.

[14:45:17:11]
But I'm working on it.
