Sorry about that start stop.

[14:09:54:01]
Okay now tell me who you are and what you do here in Nashville.

[14:10:00:07]
Hi I'm Danny Duncan.

[14:10:01:18]
I'm a producer engineer based here in Nashville Tennessee.

[14:10:05:19]
Okay.

[14:10:06:15]
Now tell me some of the stuff you worked on that we might know.

[14:10:09:19]
Worked on a lot of like R&B pop stuff and a whole lot of gospel stuff.

[14:10:17:14]
Man that ranges anywhere from Michael McDonald Michael Bolton Bruce Springsteen to a lot of gospel projects. did the last couple of Andre Crouch projects with Andre Crouch a lot of modern gospel stuff as well C.C.

[14:10:34:17]
Winans that sort of thing.

[14:10:36:17]
Very cool.

[14:10:37:17]
How did you get into the music industry?

[14:10:40:17]
Give me a little bit of your story.

[14:10:41:16]
So I was a music major in college and I just knew that I wanted to be in music.

[14:10:48:17]
I wanted to do music.

[14:10:49:22]
I didn't even know what that meant at the time but I was a music major studied arranging composition things like that.

[14:10:57:11]
Moved to Nashville started playing in a few bands and went into the studio recorded a demo with a band that I was playing in and I fell in love with the process of being in the studio.

[14:11:14:03]
When I got in the studio and saw that you can just take all this time and create and the interaction between musicians and gosh just that whole thing that comes together in the studio and the energy behind it.

[14:11:27:15]
I fell in love with that process and I thought "Man I want to be able to be in a studio every day of my life.

[14:11:34:08]
That's what I want to do."

[14:11:35:16]
More so than playing live or anything like that I just want to be in a studio creating.

[14:11:40:12]
So I was really blessed that some of the bands I was playing with one of them in particular if I'd go into the studio with them and help them make a project.

[14:11:52:16]
And I jumped at the chance because that's where I wanted to be.

[14:11:56:19]
And then I guess snowball effect from there.

[14:12:01:10]
People heard what I did on those projects and they called and said "Hey I heard what you did.

[14:12:07:11]
Would you come play on my project?"

[14:12:10:23]
And you know I make it sound like this all happened within two or three weeks.

[14:12:15:10]
And it was not the case at all you know.

[14:12:20:09]
But ended up working a lot with a guy here in town very talented guy who you know we would do the stuff in the studio.

[14:12:30:09]
We were programming and I was still just playing a lot at the time.

[14:12:35:06]
And he said to me he's like "Hey something happens when we go into the studio.

[14:12:39:05]
It doesn't quite sound the same.

[14:12:40:17]
Learn how to do it and you start recording everything for us."

[14:12:45:04]
And I knew zero about it and very telling of my age but there wasn't a whole lot on mind about it at the time either.

[14:12:52:22]
You couldn't just go Google how to do stuff.

[14:12:56:20]
So I locked myself in the studio places like this people that would let me go in and I would literally just run audio through channels and I would grab a knob and just listen to it.

[14:13:11:08]
Like overnight I would spend hours and hours.

[14:13:13:20]
I wouldn't even sleep.

[14:13:15:05]
Just learning what the knobs did.

[14:13:17:02]
I didn't even know what it was called.

[14:13:18:07]
I just learned what they did.

[14:13:20:03]
And that's how I learned it or asked friends like what does this do?

[14:13:23:16]
What does this mean?

[14:13:25:11]
And from there it developed into this whole energy around being able to create.

[14:13:32:06]
And it's not I never for good or bad I never approached it from a technical standpoint because I had no technical background in it.

[14:13:44:03]
But I approached it from a very musical standpoint.

[14:13:47:20]
Will you tell me a pillow real quick about one of those squishmallows?

[14:13:50:17]
So it was more of a musical approach than a technical approach just 'cause I didn't have that background.

[14:14:02:23]
But I had the music part.

[14:14:05:08]
So it was literally like crafting and pulling things together it's like move knobs until it sounds good until everything fits together until the song says what it's meant to say.

[14:14:20:09]
You know I always say like you know the song has to fit the lyric.

[14:14:27:12]
And I would always sit with the lyric in front of me.

[14:14:30:06]
And sonically and musically it has to say the same thing that the lyric is saying.

[14:14:36:22]
My goal is that if somebody hears a song and they don't speak the language that the song is in they still know what the song is about.

[14:14:46:23]
It has to tell the story all the way through from musically all the way to the lyric.

[14:14:53:03]
Right on.

[14:14:54:03]
How'd you get involved with Bob's album?

[14:14:58:00]
I have a very very good friend talented producer John Hartley.

[14:15:04:03]
We've worked on several things together a great friend of mine and he called and asked if I would be a part of Bob's project.

[14:15:11:16]
It was tracking it was the first day of tracking over at Insight Studios.

[14:15:17:17]
We had full band Bob was there and so he called me to come in and do a tracking date over there at Insight.

[14:15:25:18]
Did you know anything about this album coming into it?

[14:15:28:03]
I knew nothing about this album coming into it.

[14:15:33:16]
As a matter of fact I even asked John several times leading up to it "Hey what is this for?

[14:15:40:17]
Give me a little background."

[14:15:41:23]
And he would always send me an email with the list of players that were on it.

[14:15:46:06]
I'm like "Okay.

[14:15:47:06]
All right.

[14:15:48:06]
But what about the LA?

[14:15:49:06]
What is it going to sound like?

[14:15:50:06]
I want to research this a little bit.

[14:15:52:11]
I want to give you what you want."

[14:15:56:11]
And it was very late maybe like the day before when John said "It's for a guy named Bob Joyce and he paused like waiting for my response and I didn't respond.

[14:16:09:18]
He's like "Do you know who that is?"

[14:16:11:05]
I'm like "And I don't.

[14:16:13:07]
I'm sorry."

[14:16:14:13]
He goes "Okay well you can look it up online if you want and get familiar listen to some music.

[14:16:26:03]
But a lot of people think he's Elvis.

[14:16:30:07]
That's what he said.

[14:16:31:07]
I just thought okay all right well okay well we'll see.

[14:16:37:14]
It was like this should be interesting.

[14:16:40:05]
So I did.

[14:16:40:19]
I actually went online.

[14:16:42:13]
I looked at you know I didn't even get it's one of those things on Google you didn't I didn't even get all of the letters typed out.

[14:16:50:00]
And already like a list of a thousand things come up around Bob Joyce Bob Joyce's Elvis Bob Joyce sings Elvis you know it was like never ending list of stuff you know I finally found my way to the music portion and and listen to it.

[14:17:08:12]
I guess I already had this notion in my mind like okay this is going to be hilarious.

[14:17:13:14]
Let's see what this is all about.

[14:17:15:15]
And I listen and first of all He had a fantastic voice and I listened and I was shocked.

[14:17:27:09]
The first thing I listened to was something from I think it was like seven years old.

[14:17:32:06]
It was a song called "He Hideeth My Soul."

[14:17:34:08]
I found it on a project he had an older project he did.

[14:17:39:18]
I pulled it up and if someone had told me I was listening to Elvis I would have completely believed them because of the nuances in the voice the sound of the voice.

[14:17:56:04]
It's more than just the sound of the voice it's all of the little nuances that make the voice a signature thumbprint of who an artist is.

[14:18:06:02]
Right on.

[14:18:07:15]
I feel like I've given you way too much.

[14:18:10:00]
[LAUGH]

[14:18:11:01]
My God very authentic.

[14:18:13:19]
Did you grow up an Elvis fan?

[14:18:14:21]
I grew up a huge Elvis fan.

[14:18:18:08]
And maybe even by default my parents were big Elvis fans.

[14:18:25:14]
So my exposure to music growing up was they had a big wooden stereo system that sat in the living room still sitting there actually. filled with all this vinyl.

[14:18:41:02]
And they were big music fans.

[14:18:42:10]
And I would go in and my exposure to music was just listening to whatever they had.

[14:18:48:20]
And there were at least 60 or 70 records that were in this that I would put on.

[14:18:55:00]
And out of that 60 or 70 probably 40 of them were Elvis records.

[14:19:01:03]
It seemed like there's so many of them.

[14:19:03:15]
And so I would sit and listen for hours.

[14:19:06:16]
I would listen sitting in front of this big stereo unit.

[14:19:11:05]
I'd put on headphones and listen.

[14:19:13:09]
I would read the album credits as I was listening to see who was playing on it who was singing on it.

[14:19:20:09]
So from that I knew Elvis from a very early age very familiar with his sound and his voice but was genuinely a big fan as well.

[14:19:34:19]
So what did you think when you first met Bob?

[14:19:37:20]
When I first met Bob well John had already told me that some people think he's Elvis.

[14:19:45:14]
So my initial reaction before we even spoke was I was looking I guess for physical similarities.

[14:19:58:21]
So the first thing I thought is well he's so young.

[14:20:02:15]
That's what I thought. because I was doing the comparison in my mind.

[14:20:07:01]
But you know Bob is such a very sweet just genuine loving guy and he treats you just like he's known you his whole life as soon as you meet him.

[14:20:19:03]
He's very very kind and very sincere about what he's doing.

[14:20:23:12]
How is he to work with in the studio?

[14:20:27:08]
Oh he's fantastic in the studio.

[14:20:31:04]
He is looking for direction like he wants direction he wants input in everything from how he should phrase something vocally where he should be on the mic how he should approach something.

[14:20:47:21]
But still all the while being very careful to make sure that it is uniquely Bob and what he wants in the song.

[14:20:58:01]
You know when we were in the studio one of the first things that caught my attention that I'd watched all of these I've seen all of these documentaries on Elvis when he was in Graceland.

[14:21:12:20]
They did a bunch of the records in Graceland and footage in the studio where he was rehearsing the musicians.

[14:21:19:13]
And he was sitting on this stool and he was talking them through what he wanted everyone to do.

[14:21:25:04]
And it was so interesting to see the process the way that he worked with musicians.

[14:21:31:20]
One of the first things that happened in the studio was that Bob went and sat at the piano and did the same thing.

[14:21:39:17]
He gathered all the musicians everyone gathered around the piano.

[14:21:42:14]
Bob sat at the piano and showed everyone the song.

[14:21:46:19]
And he's like "And here's the feel of it."

[14:21:48:23]
And I watched him playing and the way that he moved around.

[14:21:52:20]
He knew exactly what he wanted and how he wanted it to feel and that's how he translated it to everyone by sitting there and actually playing and crafting it in very much the same way that I saw in those old documentaries of Elvis doing the same thing.

[14:22:10:06]
So was your mind breaking at that point?

[14:22:17:09]
The similarities and all of that I guess so.

[14:22:26:03]
This was the first day and I was still struck back on the physical thing of going "But he's so young."

[14:22:31:06]
I don't know how old Bob is actually but he's not 90.

[14:22:38:07]
He's sharp.

[14:22:39:06]
This is awesome.

[14:22:40:06]
I mean it's awesome.

[14:22:41:06]
I love your objective take to it.

[14:22:42:06]
This is awesome.

[14:22:43:22]
I mean it's awesome.

[14:22:45:00]
So I love your objective take to it.

[14:22:47:06]
It's like there's no way.

[14:22:49:06]
Yeah.

[14:22:49:12]
Except there's a little bit of way.

[14:22:51:06]
Right.

[14:22:52:06]
You know like so we can get into this track but let me ask you that the ending idea is can.

[14:22:59:06]
Where are you on?

[14:23:02:08]
Could it be?

[14:23:03:08]
Is it?

[14:23:04:06]
Could it not be?

[14:23:05:03]
Do you think he's Elvis Presley?

[14:23:06:06]
Oh wow.

[14:23:13:08]
I'm on the do I think I can oh gosh I'm afraid to answer this.

[14:23:24:15]
I can 100% say that he's Bob Joyce.

[14:23:34:00]
Beyond that I can 100% say I don't know.

[14:23:38:04]
Pretty great.

[14:23:39:16]
You're awesome.

[14:23:41:04]
Is that okay?

[14:23:42:04]
Is that okay to say?

[14:23:43:04]
That's the trickiest thing about it.

[14:23:44:04]
No one can say 100% he's not or 100% he is.

[14:23:47:03]
Yeah.

[14:23:48:03]
We're just like how we done?

[14:23:49:03]
That's the truth.

[14:23:50:03]
I don't know.

[14:23:51:03]
We don't know what to do with this.

[14:23:52:03]
Well listen we've wrestled with the age thing too.

[14:23:54:03]
That's the big thing.

[14:23:55:03]
Yeah.

[14:23:56:03]
But he's had a lot of work done.

[14:23:58:03]
Well it's good because I don't even how old is Bob?

[14:24:03:03]
Well that's even changed.

[14:24:05:03]
We don't know?

[14:24:06:03]
Yeah.

[14:24:07:03]
It's a moving target.

[14:24:08:15]
First he was born in 53 then it became 52.

[14:24:13:15]
So he's claiming to be 72.

[14:24:19:06]
Yeah he just had a birthday.

[14:24:20:20]
Well for 72 he looks phenomenal.

[14:24:25:20]
Whatever age he is he really looks good.

[14:24:28:19]
Most people say he looks older than 72 but he doesn't look 89 right?

[14:24:36:00]
Right.

[14:24:36:20]
Yeah he definitely does not look 90 years old.

[14:24:41:00]
I guess Elvis would be 90 in January right?

[14:24:47:09]
I knew.

[14:24:48:08]
I remember where I was when Elvis died.

[14:24:52:18]
I remember like I cried.

[14:24:56:04]
I was just 10 years old.

[14:24:58:22]
I was in the middle.

[14:25:00:22]
But I remember sitting in the backyard and my mom told me I was like "It can't be."

[14:25:07:21]
So we're getting into it?

[14:25:12:21]
Certainly.

[14:25:13:21]
So I think this stuff isn't lined up Danny.

[14:25:16:21]
Do we want to line it up?

[14:25:18:21]
I think that we just kind of walk through the songs in our trilogy.

[14:25:22:21]
I think that again this is the song that really brought Bob into the spotlight on social media.

[14:25:30:21]
And people really started talking about this comparison.

[14:25:33:21]
And is this the one from the interview that I said I saw?

[14:25:36:18]
Is this this one?

[14:25:37:19]
Yeah so I think that it's really that second verse and that glory glory hallelujah thing.

[14:25:42:14]
Right.

[14:25:43:15]
That part of the song.

[14:25:44:10]
Let's find it.

[14:25:45:22]
So we're not.

[14:25:47:05]
Is that first or second?

It taught me the beautiful blessing of the grace of God a gift only a gift that is given.

[14:28:23:14]
He taught me so much about love and about mercy.

[14:28:26:14]
I mean like I cannot give you what there's no condemnation in Christ.

There's no nothing of just love.

It's the only freedom that we have.

[14:28:37:13]
It's freedom.

[14:28:38:13]
Okay I knew it.

[14:28:39:13]
It didn't sound like Bob.

[14:28:40:13]
Wow!

[14:28:42:13]
(audience applauding) (upbeat music) Wow!

[14:29:00:07]
(singing) Wow.

[14:29:04:07]
[Music]

[14:29:31:06]
Let's listen to Elvis singing.

[14:29:40:16]
We'll go from right there.

[14:29:41:16]
[MUSIC] [Music] [music]

[14:30:37:05]
See the things that I'm listening for are like it's like what you would call the thumbprint of an artist.

[14:30:44:21]
You know when you're listening to a voice and especially as a vocal producer you're helping an artist either realize that signature of who they are uniquely them or helping them to develop that.

[14:30:58:11]
It's not enough to just be a good singer.

[14:31:01:17]
It's not just about being a great voice.

[14:31:04:05]
It's something that is uniquely you what sets you apart.

[14:31:08:18]
So you know what I would call the vocal characteristics of Elvis his thumb print are the way that he would attack notes and move between notes.

[14:31:18:13]
And you hear it right there he slides a lot.

[14:31:22:17]
Elvis would always slide up to a note and then shortly after attacking the note there's vibrato there's always that thick vibrato that he would have on the note.

[14:31:34:04]
And then as he tails off the note he kind of like it kind of lets the note go like you hear the air on the end of it.

[14:31:43:17]
That's a very very signature thing of what Elvis would do.

[14:31:47:15]
And you hear the example there as he's moving between all those notes even though they're really high.

[14:31:52:19]
But back on Bob's he does the very same thing the way that he moves between the notes.

[14:32:01:05]
And you know I mean it's certainly people are impersonators.

[14:32:07:17]
It's something that you can copy and mock as well.

[14:32:11:23]
I don't think Bob though has ever like claimed to be an impersonator.

[14:32:18:06]
Certainly not.

[14:32:19:10]
You know he's singing the way that he sings.

[14:32:22:14]
And but you definitely see some of those same characteristics that are very telling in a vocal.

[14:32:31:22]
Just huge similarities between the two.

[14:32:34:19]
Now if you were a Elvis fan and you were say doing a lot of you know Bob clearly grew up a musician.

[14:32:41:22]
So if he was doing a lot of Elvis covers would you go the distance of trying to emulate the way you attack a note or is that getting into quite the nuance of how you would?

[14:32:53:01]
You would I guess you could especially if you were trying to mimic or imitate someone.

[14:33:05:05]
I don't get that Bob is trying to imitate or sound like Elvis.

[14:33:15:04]
But he's probably a very big fan and what you listen to even without trying to imitate what you listen to you start singing like that.

[14:33:28:11]
A big thing now like with young singers that come in they've grown up listening to their favorite artists and singing with auto tune on their voice.

[14:33:38:15]
And it moves their voice quickly to a pitch sounds a little bit fake to it.

[14:33:45:13]
But I've noticed with young singers they come in and they sing like that.

[14:33:49:03]
They sing like they have auto tune on their voice.

[14:33:51:19]
It's really strange.

[14:33:53:23]
But it's because that's what they've listened to growing up.

[14:33:57:04]
That's what they've always heard.

[14:33:58:06]
So they're emulating what they have heard and what they grew up listening to.

[14:34:02:09]
Right.

[14:34:03:09]
To allay and then myself if I were to karaoke a Pearl Jam song I would try to do a deep voice.

[14:34:11:13]
I might hold the notes to a familiar length that I'm used to.

[14:34:16:01]
But I think it's interesting when you get into how you're actually sliding through notes and attacking those notes.

[14:34:21:10]
That seems far more nuanced than just if you're a fan you're going to sing like them. and I would still maybe inadvertently make it my own just 'cause I'm not a study of the voice.

[14:34:34:18]
Right and I think that's the most interesting thing about it is listening to the first track I ever heard was He Hideeth My Soul and it was from like seven years ago.

[14:34:48:10]
And I listened to that track and I heard the very same thing the way that he slid into the notes especially then I'm comparing that one.

[14:35:00:01]
It's different now what we just recorded on this newer album.

[14:35:06:21]
But it's seven years later and voices do change even over time.

[14:35:13:13]
Our vocal cords it's a muscle and so over time it does become weaker.

[14:35:22:15]
And not that you know it's less for singers because that's one of the greatest ways to keep your voice in shape is actually to sing.

[14:35:34:12]
So singers' voices change less drastically than people who don't sing because they're exercising that muscle.

[14:35:42:16]
But we do hear like there's a little bit of differences like Elvis I mean everything that we're comparing from Elvis is I mean the newest thing we can compare from Elvis is 50 years old you know?

[14:35:58:20]
And so Elvis sang in he also had a very like very dynamic and big voice meaning that it took up a lot of space in the track took up a lot of frequencies when he sang like lower octave stuff you would hear.

[14:36:15:22]
I doubt any engineer ever struggled to get Elvis's voice into a track.

[14:36:21:13]
His voice was larger than life and took up a lot of space.

[14:36:26:04]
And that's why he could sing these big anthemic ballads and show tunes and country and R&B and of course rock and roll and gospel.

[14:36:42:21]
The track would wrap itself around his voice.

[14:36:47:19]
So we're comparing that from at least 50 years ago to a voice now that is very very very similar especially in the stuff that I heard from Bob seven years ago.

[14:37:04:14]
The changes I hear now on this new record I hear Bob singing a little more forward in I don't want to say nasally but it's more you know all the bones in your face are resonating to create the sound a little less further back in your throat which was a characteristic of Elvis.

[14:37:40:16]
But I hear that and that may come with age between the seven years.

[14:37:44:21]
And I also understand I think Bob had some vocal surgery at some point.

[14:37:52:00]
I heard about I don't know anything about that but I just heard about that.

[14:37:56:08]
So but to age up an Elvis voice a likely candidate could still be Bob Joyce's voice.

[14:38:08:20]
Certainly.

[14:38:09:20]
It would be phenomenal because Bob has a really really great voice.

[14:38:18:18]
I'm imagining listening to this and going "Could a 90-year-old person be singing this?"

[14:38:27:04]
If they continuously sang and kept their voice in shape yes.

[14:38:31:13]
Yeah certainly.

[14:38:33:09]
Yeah certainly.

[14:38:35:08]
Like if they sang in church every Sunday?

[14:38:37:08]
For an hour?

[14:38:39:08]
Like if they'd sing in church every Sunday.

[14:38:41:08]
One hour.

[14:38:43:08]
So what's interesting is the American Trilogy song we're listening to there that is now 13 years old.

[14:38:48:08]
Wow.

[14:38:50:08]
So that first track so Bob recorded that 13 years ago.

[14:38:53:08]
So keep that in context.

[14:38:55:08]
Wow.

[14:38:57:08]
And let me ask you this Danny if you if someone played that for you today and you heard that that's from an iPhone that's a rough recording yeah would you with your expert ear think that maybe this could be Elvis certainly yeah especially if someone said hey I have this rare recording that I got of Elvis somebody had a tape recorder and got him so I would completely believe that now what about an impersonator how close do they get Not that you're studied on all impersonators but you know.

[14:39:31:17]
Well the thing about impersonators you know what's good about impersonators?

[14:39:35:12]
What they normally do they're very good at finding what I was talking about earlier that signature thing of what is in a person's voice the little tiny characteristics that make them who they are.

[14:39:48:06]
Impersonators the good ones find those things and they amplify those so that you really know who they're you know and they overdo it a bit.

[14:40:01:14]
And that's what you usually find in impersonators.

[14:40:04:18]
They're overdoing.

[14:40:05:18]
It's not like they're just naturally singing and that's how they sound.

[14:40:08:12]
They are attempting to sound like a particular person and overdoing those signature traits to convince you even more that that's who you're listening to.

[14:40:22:12]
That's not the case with Bob.

[14:40:24:05]
Bob's not trying to imitate anyone or trying to sing in any certain way.

[14:40:30:17]
I heard him sitting there at the piano with no mics on at all just working out a song just singing as he naturally would.

[14:40:39:18]
And that's Bob's voice.

[14:40:40:18]
That's who he is.

[14:40:41:18]
Fascinating.

[14:40:42:18]
So good.

[14:40:43:18]
Fascinating.

[14:40:44:18]
Do you want to keep going down the list?

[14:40:47:18]
Sure.

[14:40:48:18]
Let's do it.

[14:40:51:11]
Let me know if I'm not giving you what you want.

[14:40:54:12]
I'm afraid we're selling them.

[14:40:56:12]
I think you're going to be a believer.

[14:40:59:20]
You've given me more info than I had when I walked in the door that's for sure.

[14:41:03:17]
Give us an hour and you'll be convinced.

[14:41:07:17]
At the end I'm going to ask you what you guys think.

[14:41:12:23]
Let's go to Can't Help Falling in Love.

[14:41:15:04]
This is Bob.

[14:41:16:04]
[Music]

[14:41:24:17]
You hear that rungs and you hear the scoop?

[14:41:27:14]
[Music] Yeah all of those you know sliding that's [MUSIC]

[14:41:51:14]
Let's listen to this.

[14:42:07:14]
[MUSIC]

[14:42:11:00]
instantly like right off the bat you hear the slide that I'm talking about on the first two notes.

[14:42:15:09]
Wise men say only fools rush home But I can't help falling in love with you ♪ Shall I stay ♪ ♪ Would it be ♪ Very very similar here.

[14:42:55:07]
You know the only differences I hear are...

[14:42:58:22]
♪ What is man say ♪ ♪ Only through wrongs he'll ♪ The big differences I hear here Bob has a wider vibrato on the ends of those notes.

[14:43:16:20]
But this is a track from this Elvis track is from you know I don't know what year this is from but this is quite early.

[14:43:24:05]
Could be 50s or 60s?

[14:43:26:16]
It would have I think so.

[14:43:28:08]
This sounds like an early version of this recording.

[14:43:33:08]
What is the wider vibrato?

[14:43:35:09]
Wider vibrato so when you hit the note you know your voice like does a vibrato around the pitch up and down.

[14:43:45:13]
You hear it on the ends of the notes.

[14:43:48:00]
Elvis always did this.

[14:43:49:12]
Wider vibrato just means you're going a little over and a little under you know you'll hear it on the ends of the listen this one is well this one's Bob.

[14:44:02:06]
♪ Wise men say ♪ Hear the wiggle there?

[14:44:06:20]
That's vibrato.

[14:44:07:23]
♪ Only fools ♪ Here's Elvis same thing same sliding but the vibrato is not as deep.

[14:44:15:07]
♪ Wise men say ♪ ♪ Only fools rush in ♪ ♪ But I can't ♪ You know another thing that is ♪ I'm always saying ♪  The attack of the notes it's like it's a scoop up.

[14:44:41:23]
The phrase gets stronger and then it tapers off towards the end.

[14:44:47:20]
It's not the same energy all the way across it.

[14:44:50:03]
That's another signature thing of both of them.

[14:44:53:08]
Can I ask you how much of that is age?

[14:44:55:16]
Does the vibrato grow as you get older?

[14:44:58:04]
And then how much of that is live versus studio?

[14:45:00:21]
It can change as you get older.

[14:45:05:12]
Typically you have less control of your vocal cords when you get it's just a muscle just like any muscle with age they do become weaker.

[14:45:20:07]
So it's harder to control pitch as well as you age.

[14:45:26:15]
There's a brightness in that Elvis recording.

[14:45:31:12]
There's a now that's just simply that's just simply that was he was in a studio in front of a microphone and I think this one is captured from a cell phone someone's phone at church.

[14:45:44:22]
So I wouldn't put any differences in the characteristics of how they you know the actual sound of the audio on it.

[14:45:55:03]
But in terms of the voice very very similar and the way they approach notes.

[14:46:02:06]
The only thing I noticed on Bob's is a wider vibrato there.

[14:46:07:06]
Do we know when this was from?

[14:46:12:08]
The count following?

[14:46:13:14]
The last two to three years.

[14:46:16:11]
Okay it was very recent then.

[14:46:18:09]
Yeah.

[14:46:19:04]
Yeah.

[14:46:19:05]
Did you do the wings here?

[14:46:21:01]
Can I have them just stand in the back here?

[14:46:22:17]
Yeah go ahead.

[14:46:23:14]
Should we listen to something else?

[14:46:27:05]
Let's see what we have.

[14:46:28:02]
How great thou art.

[14:46:29:11]
[MUSIC]

[14:46:39:10]
Well you know what?

[14:46:40:10]
I was about to go and compare Bob's voice to this and this is Bob.

[14:46:46:10]
[LAUGH]

[14:46:47:11]
Okay.

[14:46:48:10]
Do you hear the it's that the top thing when he comes down.

[14:46:54:10]
[MUSIC]

[14:46:56:10]
You hear that little cry in his voice right there?

[14:46:59:09]
That is a wow that is an Elvis thing you know?

[14:47:16:11]
You heard that a lot not in studio recordings as much but live things from Elvis you would hear that little cry the way he does it.

[14:47:28:06]
We have this one also from... [music]

[14:47:31:06]
I think it depends on the song as well.

[14:47:53:21]
Now if you notice right here Elvis has a much wider vibrato the way that Bob did on that other song.

[14:48:02:08]
This is much wider than that recording that we listened to earlier.

[14:49:13:19]
It's like it's not just a good voice it's you know whose voice that is you know when you hear these specific things.

[14:49:22:05]
Even though we may not recognize specifically what it is it tells you who someone is.

[14:49:28:04]
Let's see.

[14:49:32:16]
Who do we have?

[14:49:35:17]
We have a isolated voice here.

[14:49:40:06]
Oh I thought we had an isolated voice.

[14:49:45:23]
We do.

[14:49:48:23]
No sorry.

[14:49:52:17]

[14:51:17:01]
He's playing he's got to be playing that as well I'm guessing because...

[14:51:32:10]
It's got to be him playing.

[14:51:35:22]
It sounds like someone...

[14:51:44:11]
You can sometimes tell when someone is also playing and singing.

[14:51:49:03]
Control and where they're leading the song they're right with the piano.

[14:51:56:17]
I can tell Bob is playing that as well right there.

[14:52:01:12]
Now who had you isolated the vocal?

[14:52:05:00]
Vocal isolation was of who?

[14:52:06:12]
That was Elvis.

[14:52:07:12]
Okay.

[14:52:08:12]
The vocal.

[14:52:09:12]
You know and there was one little if you hear you know you don't notice it as much in tracks but like you hear that little thing on the end of the he goes up you know on when you noticed it I noticed it here on this isolated vocal a little sharp On the end of phrase.

[14:52:47:02]
There was one line.

[14:52:54:08]
The little release on it right before the release of the note it's just a slight it goes just a little sharp like just a little bit up you know.

[14:53:02:13]
You probably wouldn't notice it as much if the voice wasn't as isolated as we have right now.

[14:53:09:16]
I think it's interesting that you asked whose voice that was that was isolated.

[14:53:13:18]
Oh gosh.

[14:53:16:20]
I'm playing these.

[14:53:19:23]
We're getting confused.

[14:53:20:23]
I color coded them so that I would know the difference.

[14:53:23:22]
That sort of tells a lot right there right?

[14:53:29:11]
Oh my gosh.

[14:53:30:11]
Gosh we have let's see let's see we have one more.

[14:55:06:02]
It's exciting though right?

[14:55:07:16]
It is.

[14:55:08:12]
Yeah and you know one of the guys in the church said he actually thought you know if Elvis was anointed this wonderful voice why wouldn't we expect out of all the whatever eight billion people in the world that God wouldn't give it to a second?

[14:55:24:18]
So he's like regardless of it's the same guy or not he's like God passed out that voice a second time.

[14:55:30:16]
Right right and that's certainly possible yeah.
