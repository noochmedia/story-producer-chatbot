[17:46:10:07]
[ Inaudible ]

[17:46:16:07]
All right so we're going to put off that slate.

[17:46:19:07]
Here's the name and what does this say for us?

[17:46:24:07]
Phil Fox.

[17:46:26:07]
Bro.

[17:46:30:07]
My first time today.

[17:46:32:07]
[ Laughter ]

[17:46:36:07]
Hello are we talking today?

[17:46:38:03]
Tell us I see you attend church right?

[17:46:42:16]
Yes.

[17:46:43:12]
Okay so tell me where you live and how do you associate with church.

[17:46:46:12]
Right.

[17:46:47:09]
Oh and if you don't mind can you do a few minutes?

[17:46:49:16]
Right.

[17:46:50:12]
Great.

[17:46:51:08]
Yeah.

[17:46:52:05]
Well I'm Phil Fox.

[17:46:53:21]
I'm from Charlotte North Carolina.

[17:46:56:18]
And I go out to Benton Arkansas once a month to go to church and be around some good folks and hang out with Pastor Bob Joyce.

[17:47:09:11]
I found him on YouTube back in '21 during COVID.

[17:47:16:02]
Started showing up on my YouTube feed and as this preacher supposed to be Elvis.

[17:47:22:10]
I was like yeah all right.

[17:47:24:08]
We've all heard those stories.

[17:47:27:01]
And so I started watching some of them and the ones that were doing the comparisons and all the pros and the cons of it.

[17:47:37:00]
And then I started watching his own channel and listening to some of his sermons and especially the music.

[17:47:45:10]
Music guy I love music.

[17:47:47:02]
I play guitar piano bass badly and sing even worse.

[17:47:53:15]
But I do enjoy music and I've always loved music of Elvis and many of the early era I like everything from the big band music and all the way up through the 80s rock and some of the country stuff the real country stuff.

[17:48:13:01]
So I started seeing the stuff and started investigating it and then in September of last year saw some of my friends.

[17:48:24:11]
I've been an actor and comedian and an entertainer for over 30 years.

[17:48:31:06]
I've been running with the Mayberry crowd for the Andy Griffith Show doing Ernest T. Bass of all characters and did that for over 20 years now.

[17:48:41:17]
But I saw one of our troop was visiting the church there with Mr. Bob.

[17:48:49:19]
Okay.

[17:48:51:18]
For more information on the you [BLANK_AUDIO] [ Silence ] [ Silence ] [BLANK_AUDIO]

[17:50:17:18]
Trying to think of what I was talking about.

[17:50:34:06]
[LAUGH]

[17:50:35:08]
You found another way to you know on YouTube you saw--  Right right I saw Bob.

[17:50:40:04]
Yeah.

[17:50:41:13]
Yeah so I was you know watch a lot of YouTube since COVID.

[17:50:47:02]
I actually stopped watching TV pretty much.

[17:50:51:02]
I'd lost interest in TV just watch everything on YouTube after that.

[17:50:55:01]
And kept seeing this about this preacher's supposed to be Elvis.

[17:51:00:03]
I thought you know check it out.

[17:51:02:13]
And the more I checked it out the more I thought you know there might be something to this.

[17:51:10:03]
So I started watching some of his preaching and especially the music.

[17:51:13:21]
Like I said I'm well into the music stuff love the music.

[17:51:18:01]
And I was like you know that voice is just so different.

[17:51:24:09]
And you know there's only one voice like that.

[17:51:28:08]
And regardless of you know what people think or what they believe it doesn't change any facts in the world.

[17:51:36:15]
So I watched it and one of our troop from the Mayberry crowd her and her husband she did Charlene for us and the darling girl her and her husband went and visited and they posted pictures on fakebook I like to call it.

[17:51:54:13]
And I messaged them on there or commented on their post. that I see that you met Pastor Bob.

[17:52:06:11]
And I said I plan on going out there before the year is up.

[17:52:10:04]
This was last September in '23.

[17:52:13:06]
And about that time after I messaged him then my old friend Steve Barfield messaged me and said hey Phil if you wanna come out here let me know.

[17:52:24:03]
I've got a place you can stay.

[17:52:26:02]
And you can come out here hang out with us and meet Bob and get to hang out a while and enjoy some good music and good preaching.

[17:52:35:20]
I said "You know I'm up for that."

[17:52:37:03]
Now I've told Pastor Bob and many others that I've come through life as a preacher's kid deacon's kid and parents went from my mother was Catholic my father was Southern Baptist in North Carolina and so I was a batholic as a child. and I was an altar boy on Sunday morning and Baptist RAs Royal Ambassadors on Sunday night and Wednesdays.

[17:53:06:03]
So I grew up with stuff grew up in the age my mother worked for Jim and Tammy Baker at the old PTL Praise the Lord Club back in the 70s and early 80s.

[17:53:15:05]
And so I grew up down there with all of that and the gospel music and the best of the best of Southern gospel.

[17:53:23:13]
And so I was raised in church and knew all their stuff on that.

[17:53:29:03]
Parents got into more of the I'm trying to think what they call not the Pentecostal but sort of like that non-denominational stuff and then into the Hebrew.

[17:53:39:21]
And I've come to the point in my life where I've pretty much stopped believing in anything.

[17:53:46:17]
I don't really believe in God or Jesus or Yeshua and a lot of things.

[17:53:54:05]
I'm just kind of at that point in my life.

[17:53:56:01]
So I've heard it all before I've seen it all before but I wanted to meet this Pastor Bob to see is he Elvis or is he not Elvis?

[17:54:10:07]
And so set up with Steve went out to Benton Arkansas back December of '23 and for the Christmas party.

[17:54:20:20]
He said "That'd be a great time to come." to be some non-church function kind of get together celebration and be a good time to meet folks.

[17:54:31:05]
So I went out and when you meet Bob Joyce if you're looking for Elvis you don't find Elvis.

[17:54:40:21]
You're not gonna find Elvis in him.

[17:54:43:03]
But when you meet Bob you fall in love with who he is.

[17:54:47:09]
He is a very sincere person.

[17:54:49:15]
He's the type of man that looks you straight in the eye.

[17:54:51:21]
When he speaks with you he's looking you in the eye.

[17:54:54:08]
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

[17:54:57:04]
And you can tell if someone is full of beans or if they're for real.

[17:55:02:16]
And so I met Bob and you can't help but love the guy when you meet him.

[17:55:07:17]
He's just that type of person.

[17:55:08:19]
He's warm he's a very caring person and his wife Wilena is just as lovely as she can be and one of the sweetest people.

[17:55:18:09]
And all those at the church You go looking for Elvis but you find Bob and you find Wilena and you find Steve and you find Phil Mask and a plethora of good people there that extend the love from their hearts to you and they draw you in.

[17:55:40:23]
So I travel once a month from Charlotte which is 800 plus miles each way and to be there for at least one time a month and hang out with people that I love that love me regardless of my belief.

[17:55:57:12]
I may not believe the same things they do but I can still share in the love and I really do appreciate that.

[17:56:06:03]
So although you're on a different path right now with your belief how is Pastor Bob sort of still working in you?

[17:56:18:04]
Well he and I've told I said you know I don't believe the way you believe.

[17:56:24:10]
I said but I said you got your work cut out for you.

[17:56:28:00]
And he just kind of laughs and like okay.

[17:56:31:18]
And so I'm sure he prays for me probably constantly.

[17:56:36:05]
Daily says we got to get this heathen back in here in the bowl.

[17:56:40:03]
But I said he's just so warm and inviting.

[17:56:45:03]
And he reaches out to your soul when he preaches and I told him I said "He's the only preacher that I watch "and that I will watch and listen to."

[17:56:58:12]
So I said "You got your work cut out for you."

[17:57:00:18]
And he said "Okay."

[17:57:02:11]
And just enjoy being with him.

[17:57:05:11]
So having seen him online when you first met him did you think you met Alex?

[17:57:12:15]
Actually I did not.

[17:57:17:11]
I did not because he is so real as Pastor Bob Joyce which he has had more time being Pastor Bob Joyce than if he was Elvis in a previous I won't say previous life but in a former situation.

[17:57:42:04]
And there are the pros and there are the cons of it of him being and not being.

[17:57:49:10]
I mean it's pretty darn interesting though.

[17:57:52:20]
I mean there's just so many similarities and coincidences as some would put it but it's a lot of evidence there that he may have been the artist formerly known as.

[17:58:06:07]
How do you think that story and I'm talking about you think the power of that story that this man is maybe the biggest--  Right.

[17:58:17:17]
Celebrating his life.

[17:58:19:02]
Well he really didn't have a life in the later 70s.

[17:58:24:01]
He was a prisoner inside of Graceland and inside of his fame made him a prisoner.

[17:58:32:01]
He couldn't go to the grocery store.

[17:58:34:04]
And I thought about this then I was 13 years old when the incident happened when he died at August the 16th of 77 I was 13 years old.

[17:58:44:04]
I seen the picture of him in the casket that I think a cousin had taken for the inquirer.

[17:58:50:22]
And I thought that's not him that's a 50s Elvis.

[17:58:53:13]
Look at it.

[17:58:54:11]
He was a big catfish headed brascal when he died and no disrespect to him.

[17:58:59:20]
But he had to wait on him.

[17:59:02:09]
And I knew he wasn't dead from the time I was 13 years old.

[17:59:07:09]
I've always believed that he was alive.

[17:59:12:08]
Never in my wildest dream thought that I would ever run across him find him because I wasn't looking for him.

[17:59:21:03]
But I always loved his movies.

[17:59:22:06]
If they came on TV we watched them growing up.

[17:59:25:11]
And I've still watched them.

[17:59:26:10]
I've got them all on DVDs and from time to time I put them in.

[17:59:30:06]
And the music how do you have Christmas time without Elvis music?

[17:59:34:23]
But it's just I lost my train of thought there. (laughing) Yeah yeah get chasing rabbits.

[17:59:46:13]
I get chasing rabbits.

[17:59:47:23]
But yeah the impact of the moment.

[17:59:52:23]
But he was trapped.

[17:59:56:05]
He was trapped in lifestyle.

[17:59:58:16]
Like I said he couldn't go anywhere without being mobbed.

[18:00:02:00]
He had no life from the time he made it famous.

[18:00:06:01]
Say what is it 54 55 or so.

[18:00:09:02]
First few years gonna be fun like anything else any job.

[18:00:13:04]
But then it becomes work and you have to hide.

[18:00:16:14]
So he's been in hiding his whole life basically as a young man oh he's had to hide.

[18:00:24:11]
And I think he wanted a normal life.

[18:00:28:06]
He wanted to be able to breathe 'cause he loves the outdoors.

[18:00:32:06]
He loves working with his hands carpentry stuff which is I think correlating to his job as a pastor following the life of Jesus or Yeshua and who was a carpenter. so I think it works good.

[18:00:47:23]
But he is very serious about being a pastor.

[18:00:52:02]
I mean I've watched the videos I was like the man is serious.

[18:00:58:09]
He believes in his faith fully and he's out there on a mission.

[18:01:03:23]
And I'd heard stories about Elvis having an epiphany as he would drive the bus.

[18:01:08:23]
They said he loved to drive the bus because he couldn't drive anywhere around Memphis area.

[18:01:13:18]
And you know he'd be mobbed unless he went out in the middle of the night.

[18:01:16:19]
And still even then sometimes but he liked to drive the bus.

[18:01:20:06]
And I heard a story about him going across the desert when they were going I guess out west.

[18:01:25:13]
And he's like "Oh God oh God."

[18:01:29:04]
And then he pulls the bus over and he walks off out into the desert.

[18:01:32:13]
They said he had an epiphany then.

[18:01:35:11]
And so was it of being a pastor?

[18:01:39:22]
Was it of getting out of his current situation at the time to where he could have a life but he come back as a renewed man and got on the bus I guess finished out did their tour and enjoyed and maybe start to set things in motion for a few years down the road.

[18:02:00:16]
Do you still think about the chances that he's Elvis when you're around him now?

[18:02:08:14]
Yeah yeah.

[18:02:09:15]
Yeah I mean everyone that goes to the church pretty much are seeking.

[18:02:16:23]
They're looking for that answer.

[18:02:18:18]
They wanna know is he definitively was he Elvis?

[18:02:23:11]
We know he's not now.

[18:02:24:23]
If he is the artist formerly known as then he set that to the side.

[18:02:34:02]
He gave that up and he made a vow to do what he's doing now.

[18:02:39:21]
And for the betterment of humanity in his eyes.

[18:02:44:18]
And I think he's fulfilling his calling.

[18:02:49:03]
That's awesome.

[18:02:52:07]
So good.

[18:02:54:04]
Questions?

[18:02:55:00]
Man it's good huh?

[18:03:00:09]
Yeah I like the nailing.

[18:03:01:21]
I really like the insight.

[18:03:04:19]
I really like the See I come into it from the non-religious view of it.

[18:03:13:21]
I mean I go because I enjoy the camaraderie the love of the people.

[18:03:20:01]
That's why I go.

[18:03:21:01]
I keep coming back.

[18:03:22:01]
And that's why I'm here today.

[18:03:26:11]
We're here to where we're coming for an album release party and a documentary.

[18:03:33:22]
So there's a lot to it.

[18:03:36:00]
But to have a friend like Bob and most people that get to know him on the little bit of a level that we do because you never really know people 'cause we all hide things from ourselves and from others that you don't want people to know.

[18:03:57:21]
But when you get to know him just a little bit is such a warm loving person.

[18:04:04:18]
And so was Elvis.

[18:04:06:17]
So he has basically the same the same love for people that Elvis had.

[18:04:15:00]
And if he is Elvis or was Elvis then he's he's not changed.

[18:04:21:21]
He just gave up the puff and the posh to live a normal life and to do what he was called to do.

[18:04:31:13]
Have you heard the new album?

[18:04:32:21]
Yes yes.

[18:04:34:04]
I think it's pretty awesome.

[18:04:36:18]
Pretty awesome stuff.

[18:04:38:03]
The voice is there.

[18:04:40:20]
I mean here's a man if he's Bob Joyce and was born Bob Joyce he's 72 years old.

[18:04:50:15]
Pretty awesome voice for 72.

[18:04:54:16]
If he once upon a time in a land far far away was Elvis Presley he's got that golden velvet voice at 89 years old almost 90 years old and can still put it out there just like velvet or blue suede shoes.

[18:05:16:21]
It's that smooth.

[18:05:18:17]
When you stand next to Bob which age do you think he is?

[18:05:22:20]
That seems to be in between because you see signs that he's not a 72 year old man unless he was a feeble 72 year old.

[18:05:37:15]
Bob is not feeble by any stretch of the word.

[18:05:40:20]
He is just as vibrant and vigorous as any man say 40s or 50s.

[18:05:49:22]
He's at least 30 to 40 years past that but he goes and he does things.

[18:05:56:04]
I mean he walks.

[18:05:57:08]
When you see him preach when he sings.

[18:06:01:08]
At the church he's a little more reserved when he's singing.

[18:06:04:10]
He's not quite belting it out but like in Hot Springs when we had the service there a few weeks back he brought it out the full stage.

[18:06:16:14]
I mean he had a full audience.

[18:06:18:08]
I think that he was probably if he was the artist formerly known as then he is maybe reliving a little bit and seeing would I really want this again which he would never want what he had.

[18:06:40:19]
But just a little sprinkling of it wouldn't hurt.

[18:06:45:06]
Would he like that?

[18:06:46:06]
He doesn't like a lot of hoopla and a lot of glory thrown on him because he credits that to a higher source which is wonderful.

[18:06:59:18]
I mean he doesn't think too highly of himself when it comes to that.

[18:07:04:15]
He's like "Oh nobody wants to hear an old man sing.

[18:07:07:18]
"Nobody wants to hear an old man preach.

[18:07:10:05]
"And oh I can't play this piano.

[18:07:12:15]
"We need a piano player."

[18:07:14:15]
And I'm like dude you know you've got a golden voice.

[18:07:19:15]
You can play the piano.

[18:07:23:00]
I told him when we were in Hot Springs I was like he's like Phil if we could just find somebody that could play this piano now after we'd set it up.

[18:07:30:19]
And I said we've got you.

[18:07:33:05]
He said oh man I can't play that.

[18:07:35:01]
I said shoot I'd love to play like you play.

[18:07:37:16]
I said I just set the clunk on it you know?

[18:07:40:06]
I said and I know as badly as I play there are people that wish they could play as badly as me.

[18:07:45:14]
I said I'd love to play as good as you.

[18:07:48:01]
He said well you don't set your sights very high do you?

[18:07:50:18]
I said well if I set them low enough I can hit the target you see?

[18:07:53:23]
That's what we're after is hit the target.

[18:07:56:03]
But he's just he's a fun guy and loves to laugh and have fun and to just be with people and love the people around him.

[18:08:07:06]
Has he ever had the answer to the have you or Ben Arana always had the answer to the Elvis conspiracy stuff?

[18:08:12:17]
No no.

[18:08:13:13]
Even like that?

[18:08:15:02]
Yeah even at that there was one lady in the audience which I was kind of working backstage you know to kind of help in case something happens back there you know be somebody back there to cover it.

[18:08:26:08]
And so I didn't hear a lot of it going on after I watched it you know I heard the lady you know something about you know go Elvis or something like that after he finished one little correlation in his sermon which I know a lot of people probably called it the audience I believe did but they may have just cheered one word or name.

[18:08:51:17]
He was saying in the sermon that we should seek Jesus seek God not seek man.

[18:09:01:08]
He said we don't need Bob or you don't need Bob you don't need Paul you don't need Peter you don't need ум you no need Elvis you need Jesus.

[18:09:14:14]
That in itself if you kind of look at the correlation of the people that he was naming you know Saul became Paul and Simon became Cephas in the Aramaic or the Hebrew and in the Greek it was Petra or Peter and then we've got Bob well one in and Elvis the other in.

[18:09:40:08]
So there's three people that may have all three of them been different before they saw the light.

[18:09:49:21]
Come out the other side as someone else.

[18:09:54:01]
Last question for me.

[18:09:57:13]
Why what is sort of the how would you describe of the unwritten rule amongst all the Congress not to bring it up in front?

[18:10:07:12]
Well that's common courtesy you know as humans.

[18:10:12:20]
You don't throw things up in people's faces you know.

[18:10:18:04]
I did a song back in January of '24 for them.

[18:10:21:21]
It was from the last movie that Elvis did.

[18:10:25:08]
And the song was "Let Us Pray."

[18:10:27:18]
It was a movie called Change of Habit with Mary Tyler Moore in it.

[18:10:33:08]
And I did that song and you know I was kind of should I do it should I not?

[18:10:41:01]
It is a gospel song.

[18:10:43:22]
It's a wonderful song.

[18:10:44:22]
I've always loved songs because I like the movies.

[18:10:49:00]
But the song was rocking and I really liked it. and I did it and he smacked me on the back as they come by me he said "Great job Phil I love that song."

[18:11:01:01]
And I was like "Cool that's cool."

[18:11:03:05]
But like I said you don't wanna throw things in the face but he has a son that was an Elvis impersonator or tribute artist as they're called nowadays and they've done stuff at the church like that.

[18:11:19:17]
He's performed there so we've done a few things.

[18:11:24:05]
But you don't ever wanna throw things up in people's face like "Yeah I believe you're such and such."

[18:11:29:20]
