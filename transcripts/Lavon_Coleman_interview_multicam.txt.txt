[17:35:33:07]
I don't even have a watch on or anything.

[17:35:45:00]
No jewelry.

[17:35:46:00]
Guys this is I was like I don't even have on a piece of jewelry.

[17:35:51:07]
This is not good.

[17:35:52:07]
[ Inaudible ]

[17:36:18:06]
Yeah bring it on Teresa.

[17:36:19:16]
No I'm just kidding.

[17:36:20:23]
Sometimes I can't stand a  There you go fancy.

[17:36:44:21]
Yeah it is fancy.

[17:36:46:04]
All right look at that.

[17:36:51:19]
See I was too tall after.

[17:36:53:07]
Comfy too.

[17:36:54:03]
There we go.

[17:36:56:07]
Nice beautiful.

[17:36:58:19]
Spot check this camera.

[17:37:00:09]
I'm gonna strangle you. (laughing)  It's gonna be great. (laughing) John should be here.

[17:37:21:19]
He should have been here.

[17:37:23:04]
I would have begged him to come if he had known he wasn't going to England.

[17:37:29:14]
You gotta tell me if I don't like it we can redo it in Franklin.

[17:37:41:16]
It's different when she's in the middle of the room.

[17:37:50:03]
Yeah you had time to think though and I haven't.

[17:37:53:03]
This would be part of the director's cut.

[17:37:54:22]
Yeah okay.

[17:37:55:22]
All right.

[17:37:58:12]
Okay.

[17:38:01:03]
All right so there's some things you probably don't have to think about.

[17:38:04:01]
Tell me your name and where do you live.

[17:38:06:00]
I have to think about that. (laughing)  Okay hi I'm LaVon Coleman and I live in Franklin Tennessee.

[17:38:13:10]
Divide my time between there and Coleman with my children and grandchildren.

[17:38:17:05]
And what else?

[17:38:19:16]
That's it.

[17:38:20:13]
That's great.

[17:38:21:08]
How long have you lived in Franklin?

[17:38:22:21]
Gosh 15 years maybe I guess yeah.

[17:38:26:10]
Okay.

[17:38:27:08]
Yeah.

[17:38:27:22]
How is it that you became a congregate of Pastor Joyce's church?

[17:38:33:12]
Yeah you know it was simply the algorithms.

[17:38:37:18]
He passed on the computer and I started watching.

[17:38:40:23]
And it was great.

[17:38:43:05]
So I wanted to visit.

[17:38:44:13]
And so from there it's just a special place.

[17:38:48:08]
And you just grow to love the people there.

[17:38:51:05]
You grow to love Pastor Bob.

[17:38:53:09]
And so I've been going about a year and a half off and on when I can.

[17:38:57:23]
So you found your way there because of all the social media?

[17:39:02:04]
No not even that.

[17:39:03:09]
Just his preaching.

[17:39:04:23]
Well social media yes but just the preaching.

[17:39:07:04]
So you found so not any of the theory.

[17:39:10:07]
Not the conspiracy.

[17:39:11:19]
You found him through just was it during COVID or was it just you were shopping churches?

[17:39:16:11]
Yeah probably during COVID yeah.

[17:39:18:16]
Just listening to different sermons and different people on the internet yeah.

[17:39:22:23]
Right and so clearly tell me about Pastor Bob's voice.

[17:39:27:23]
Pastor Bob's voice is amazing.

[17:39:34:06]
It's amazing.

[17:39:35:11]
It's very special it's very comforting.

[17:39:41:07]
It takes you back to the past to things that were special to you.

[17:39:47:12]
And it's very special to me that we are recording it.

[17:39:51:23]
Yeah.

[17:39:52:19]
So Tony how did the album come to be?

[17:39:54:14]
Yeah well you know through Ori Music Group Ori International Streaming Ori International I'd asked if they would do it and he said yes and then we had to--  Wait wait hold on.

[17:40:07:00]
Okay.

[17:40:07:20]
How did you come up with the idea then?

[17:40:09:02]
What do you mean?

[17:40:09:22]
Oh well okay so Pastor Bob's voice it just we wanted it we at the church we wanted it to be on a special album.

[17:40:23:05]
We just wanted it recorded.

[17:40:25:13]
And we asked him and it wasn't just me I don't wanna take credit for it because people in the church asked him and he thought about it for a while And he never did say yes.

[17:40:37:09]
It was at music practice one day and he was practicing and said oh and you know that album we're gonna do in Franklin.

[17:40:43:19]
And I was like what?

[17:40:45:18]
So that's how he said yes.

[17:40:48:12]
And I ran up to him after I said does that mean yes?

[17:40:50:23]
And he said yeah yeah okay okay.

[17:40:53:00]
And so it just went from there.

[17:40:55:21]
We started and I've thanked him many times for trusting me with it.

[17:41:00:22]
It's very special.

[17:41:02:08]
So you and fellow Cargots wanted to put an album in.

[17:41:05:23]
Now Pastor Rob has done albums before right?

[17:41:07:22]
He has yeah he's recorded albums but this one is a world-class album with just world-class musicians and we did it at Insight you know a fabulous studio and we just wanted it done a really something that will go out to the world because it will it'll go all over the world.

[17:41:26:03]
Yeah so tell me more about you know your interest in sort of the music side so Clearly I mean you've always been a churchgoer.

[17:41:34:11]
Right.

[17:41:35:07]
You found his church and you fell in love with his sound.

[17:41:37:12]
And so you personally are one of the congregates then that got involved in wanting to get this.

[17:41:42:21]
Tell me a little bit more of like the your reasoning behind wanting an album on him.

[17:41:46:21]
Well you know the voice his voice is so special that we just I just wanted the world to hear it.

[17:41:55:10]
I wanted it to go out and let it affect people you know Because people who come to the church are from everywhere.

[17:42:03:06]
We are from different backgrounds.

[17:42:04:21]
We all have our own home churches a lot of us from the past or current.

[17:42:10:05]
And we come there it's a very special place.

[17:42:14:12]
And people are close and connected.

[17:42:16:22]
And the music is great.

[17:42:19:17]
And it just needed to be out there needed to be out there to the world.

[17:42:24:16]
So what was it like recording the album?

[17:42:25:23]
What was it like in the studio?

[17:42:27:16]
Oh it was amazing.

[17:42:29:04]
Absolutely amazing.

[17:42:30:09]
Yeah.

[17:42:30:23]
It was um every song he did you know we were just like in awe.

[17:42:35:16]
Um yeah it was good.

[17:42:37:16]
Were you there for the whole thing?

[17:42:38:16]
Oh yeah.

[17:42:39:08]
Oh yes.

[17:42:39:22]
Of course.

[17:42:40:16]
Yeah.

[17:42:41:18]
Yes.

[17:42:41:23]
The whole time.

[17:42:42:16]
Yeah.

[17:42:43:16]
Tell me more about the congregation.

[17:42:44:16]
So so people have sort of found uh Pastor Bob and the church.

[17:42:49:16]
Right.

[17:42:50:16]
Because they they stream online every Sunday right?

[17:42:52:16]
Mm-hmm.

[17:42:53:16]
They do.

[17:42:53:16]
Yes.

[17:42:53:16]
It necessarily isn't like a local church.

[17:42:56:03]
It's almost people's often times secondary church for people is that right?

[17:43:00:18]
Well not necessarily secondary for most of the people but what I mean is some people have churches they've grown up in but when you find Pastor Bob it's so special but there's a small group that live close by but the members I mean they drive from everywhere.

[17:43:17:19]
Some one lady drives three hours every Sunday she's done it for seven years.

[17:43:22:05]
Other people drive two hours it's nothing.

[17:43:24:17]
We have people from Georgia who drive Steve and Teresa drive for hours and my drive is about six hours.

[17:43:31:23]
Yeah and it's worth every mile.

[17:43:35:09]
Yeah.

[17:43:36:05]
How much time do you spend out there?

[17:43:38:08]
Well I go every Sunday I can.

[17:43:40:13]
I don't get to go every Sunday but every Sunday I can yeah.

[17:43:45:15]
How many is that 26 Sundays?

[17:43:48:03]
Is that 50 Sundays?

[17:43:49:09]
Well you know I really haven't counted it.

[17:43:53:13]
I could count up but it's been about a year and a half.

[17:43:56:02]
And I would say average maybe every three weeks or so.

[17:43:59:12]
Yeah.

[17:44:00:16]
Maybe more but yeah.

[17:44:02:21]
And what's your relationship with Pastor Bob and his wife?

[17:44:07:04]
They are just precious.

[17:44:08:20]
Yeah they are precious.

[17:44:10:17]
They're very sweet.

[17:44:12:18]
And Pastor Bob it's just like a magnet.

[17:44:16:08]
You know people just he's drawn you know he just has a drawing spirit and people just come there.

[17:44:24:02]
And you know my basically my story honestly is not music.

[17:44:29:14]
I was a business owner for 30 years and when my former husband and I built a business international business but I was I had a very I had a sadness about me a deep sadness.

[17:44:41:21]
And as I began to listen to Pastor Bob It lifted as I listened to him online.

[17:44:48:14]
It lifted and I really never knew that I would feel the joy of the Lord again.

[17:44:55:05]
And it just and people write him all the time and say that you saved me from suicide you saved me my life you changed my life.

[17:45:03:18]
It's just something about his ministry that draws people and that can affect people in that way.

[17:45:10:10]
And so that's when after I've been listening for about six months I went.

[17:45:15:18]
And at that point I went every week for like eight to 10 weeks.

[17:45:20:06]
And just grew close to people.

[17:45:22:15]
And so now I go as often as I can.

[17:45:25:08]
But it's just very special you know.

[17:45:28:22]
And his wife is precious.

[17:45:31:15]
We love them.

[17:45:32:13]
You know you go there and you just love them you know.

[17:45:36:09]
Yeah.

[17:45:37:05]
Yeah.

[17:45:37:06]
That's amazing.

[17:45:38:05]
Have you seen some of the online conspiracies about who Pastor Bob might be?

[17:45:42:03]
Oh yeah how can you not right?

[17:45:44:04]
How can you not?

[17:45:45:01]
Yes.

[17:45:45:22]
And you've heard him clearly there's some similarities there that you would understand.

[17:45:50:21]
And so do you think it's a good thing for the church to have this kind of enthusiasm and excitement around him because it helps bring people to the message or?

[17:45:59:15]
You mean the conspiracy things on?

[17:46:02:02]
Well I don't know that I have an opinion about that so much as you can't get away from that.

[17:46:07:15]
If you have a computer you cannot get away from that.

[17:46:10:16]
But being from Memphis growing up in Memphis and my age we have memories of that person when I was young and being around Memphis and the things that Elvis would do and those kind of things.

[17:46:25:22]
And so he was always special.

[17:46:27:22]
But for the most part when we're there at the church we don't think about that.

[17:46:32:22]
Pastor Bob is Pastor Bob.

[17:46:35:02]
And we love Pastor Bob.

[17:46:37:14]
You don't sit around and think about Oh you know oh this or oh that.

[17:46:42:17]
And kind of the saying is really that people come there sometimes looking for another person and they just fall in love with the church congregation with Pastor Bob and the ministry.

[17:46:55:18]
That's amazing.

[17:46:56:15]
Yeah yeah it is.

[17:46:57:07]
So did you ever meet Elvis as a younger?

[17:47:01:01]
Oh I have one story.

[17:47:02:22]
Yeah well when I was 10 he played Santa Claus at our local yeah the local town center.

[17:47:10:13]
And so I saw him then when I was 10.

[17:47:13:17]
But being in Memphis you just saw him all the time around town.

[17:47:17:15]
And then I went to a couple concerts.

[17:47:20:03]
Yeah.

[17:47:20:23]
Yeah.

[17:47:21:00]
So what do people from Memphis tend to think of remember or how do they categorize Elvis?

[17:47:28:16]
Is there a like Steven mentioned about some people wanna say that there's these darker sides these darker stories and yet we also hear all these wonderful stories about just how altruistic the guy was or how much like a pastor he already was like whatever it may be.

[17:47:44:12]
So what's your take on that?

[17:47:46:07]
Well my dad was a minister so I was never a person at the gates that wasn't going to happen okay.

[17:47:52:02]
But my dad had an auto parts store and Elvis and his guys would come in and out you know and he was just honestly to a lot of Memphis people he was just a normal guy.

[17:48:01:19]
He wanted to be a normal guy.

[17:48:05:00]
And as so many other people will say that he just gave gifts he just bought presents there was a lady who needed a wheelchair and didn't have it he went and found the best wheelchair in town took it to her.

[17:48:20:01]
You could just talk all day long about the things that he did because that's what his heart was about.

[17:48:25:16]
And the people who were fond of him were very fond of him and loved him just loved those things about him.

[17:48:32:01]
Not because of that he was Elvis but because he was a giving in the position that he was in.

[17:48:39:01]
Right.

[17:48:40:01]
He still was a...

[17:48:41:01]
Yes.

[17:48:42:01]
He wanted to share it.

[17:48:44:01]
And in so many ways that's how my dad was right?

[17:48:48:00]
My dad he just gave he gave away my dad didn't drive a car he had an old beat up jeep and he didn't wear jewelry and Elvis was a lot like my dad in terms of giving to people. to people and that made it very special.

[17:49:04:19]
You know but it's probably what's special about Bob Joyce too.

[17:49:08:20]
Bob Joyce is very special.

[17:49:11:14]
Yeah very simple just simple you know.

[17:49:16:04]
Yeah.

[17:49:17:00]
How was it when you first met Bob yourself?

[17:49:18:21]
I was glad to meet him.

[17:49:21:15]
Yeah I was very glad to meet him.

[17:49:23:15]
And it was just you know we just chatted but I knew that I wanted to come back the next week.

[17:49:29:08]
I knew that I needed to come back.

[17:49:33:06]
And is the congregation close also or is everything like tell me about the relationships amongst sort of the regulars of the church.

[17:49:41:14]
Yeah well as I said we are for the most part so many people well one couple moved from Hawaii there.

[17:49:49:13]
One young lady recently last year moved from Illinois.

[17:49:53:17]
Some people pack up and move there to be there But even the ones of us who can't we have our own lives.

[17:50:00:21]
We have families.

[17:50:02:10]
We're from different backgrounds different locations.

[17:50:06:02]
But you come there and we are connected and feel a connection.

[17:50:11:10]
You know feel a very strong connection.

[17:50:13:23]
Can you put your finger on what it was about Bob that you think really sort of re-- really brought light back into your life?

[17:50:24:01]
The sermons.

[17:50:25:18]
Yeah the sermons.

[17:50:27:08]
I didn't even know it.

[17:50:28:12]
I mean I was just listening because we couldn't go to church.

[17:50:32:05]
And but I realized you know I realized after a few months that hey you know God has healed me.

[17:50:42:10]
And of this sadness that I had.

[17:50:46:01]
And my daughter even said to me mom who are you?

[17:50:49:06]
I don't who are you?

[17:50:50:08]
I don't know this person because my son remembered me when I was young but my daughter lived through a lot of sadness with me and she didn't remember that person.

[17:51:01:19]
Yeah.

[17:51:02:15]
Is there a certain approach you think maybe he takes to preaching the word that speaks to maybe some people who are lost or are needing to die to self are needing to you know what I mean?

[17:51:17:17]
Right yes.

[17:51:18:13]
Put it right on its head.

[17:51:19:21]
Yes.

[17:51:20:19]
Well for those of us who've grown up Christian grown in churches it's the encouragement.

[17:51:27:11]
For people who don't know the Lord it's the introduction of the Holy Ghost and the Lord.

[17:51:34:00]
God is real you know he's not something far away he's real and your relationship with him needs to be real.

[17:51:40:23]
And I would think you know I can't speak for the people who don't know the Lord but I would think that that's what it is.

[17:51:49:04]
Yeah it is amazing.

[17:51:51:13]
Brian peanut gallery?

[17:51:53:17]
Any questions?

[17:51:54:13]
I'm bobbing my head too much right now.

[17:51:57:13]
Just trying to think if there's more about the album specifically.

[17:52:01:13]
Yeah ask about that.

[17:52:02:13]
What's your favorite song on the new album?

[17:52:04:13]
Just going to do a little bit.

[17:52:05:13]
Oh my goodness yes.

[17:52:07:13]
A quick adjustment.

[17:52:08:13]
Okay yes thank you.

[17:52:09:13]
Just going to sag it a little bit.

[17:52:10:13]
Okay yeah.

[17:52:11:13]
There you go.

[17:52:12:13]
That'll be better.

[17:52:13:13]
Thank you.

[17:52:14:13]
I need to stop moving so much.

[17:52:16:13]
I love every song but probably probably "Safely Home yeah.

[17:52:27:21]
Probably "Safely Home that will be the name of the album.

[17:52:30:18]
And it's a beautiful song Pastor Bob wrote it and it's really great.

[17:52:36:09]
How was he in the studio?

[17:52:39:06]
He was awesome.

[17:52:40:08]
Oh yeah he was just awesome.

[17:52:41:18]
Just comfortable he loved being with the musicians.

[17:52:45:00]
You know we have a great producer John Hartley and he and John just connected right away and he just connected with all the musicians and yeah.

[17:52:54:02]
It was very special.

[17:52:55:10]
Oh that's great.

[17:52:56:17]
When is the album coming out?

[17:52:58:00]

So I don't know yet.

[17:54:04:17]
Alright so I still have to ask you what do you think about the conspiracy around around Pastor Bob and possibly being Elvis Presley?

[17:54:13:17]
I think that I don't think about it.

[17:54:16:15]
Yeah.

[17:54:17:05]
Honestly I really don't think about it.

[17:54:20:08]
If it were to come out that he was once that person then that's fine.

[17:54:26:21]
But if he never was that person that's just fine too.

[17:54:32:03]
Yeah.

[17:54:32:22]
So once you get to know Bob --  Oh yeah.  -- it doesn't matter right?

[17:54:36:17]
It doesn't matter.

[17:54:38:01]
Now how about when you heard him in the studio though?

[17:54:40:01]
It had to be in the back of your mind a little bit there right?

[17:54:43:01]
Oh it's always in the back of your mind when he sings.

[17:54:45:01]
I mean you can't help that yeah.

[17:54:47:01]
It's always like oh my gosh you know.

[17:54:50:01]
I mean the fact is that you say to yourself "Really?

[17:54:54:01]
This?

[17:54:54:12]
Really?

[17:54:55:01]
No right?

[17:54:55:12]
No right?

[17:54:56:01]
What?"

[17:54:58:01]
Yeah and yeah it's always there when he sings.

[17:55:03:01]
It's fun.

[17:55:04:03]
It's awesome.

[17:55:05:00]
Yeah no it was terrible do it again.

[17:55:08:02]
I was bobbing my head too much and moving around.

[17:55:12:00]
No it was too like.

[17:55:17:00]
You should do interviews for a living right?

[17:55:19:00]
It's amazing.

[17:55:20:00]
Everything was a usable sound bite.

[17:55:23:00]
Yeah.

[17:55:24:00]
Not the bobbing in the moving I mean I need to stop.

[17:55:28:00]
Oh my gosh I thought you were wonderful.

[17:55:30:00]
I think that was beautiful.

[17:55:31:00]
Did I say anything needs to be corrected though?

[17:55:33:00]
No.

[17:55:33:20]
Oh that last little part was kinda sitting on the fence.

[17:55:37:17]
That what?

[17:55:38:13]
What was?

[17:55:39:09]
That last little part you kinda sitting on the fence there. (laughing)  Well you don't want me to go all in do you?

[17:55:48:00]
Well you push me all in.

[17:55:50:09]
You are all in.

[17:55:51:22]
I asked him what percentage did he think.

[17:55:54:08]
Yeah.

[17:55:55:04]
And he just went "Are you kidding me?"

[17:55:56:07]
Oh that's right.

[17:55:58:04]
Are you kidding me?

[17:55:59:22]
Well I'm just getting going.

[17:56:00:22]
Now you can ask me more.

[17:56:01:22]
Well there you go there you go.

[17:56:04:21]
Well I mean I understand the congregation doesn't talk about it right?

[17:56:09:06]
Yeah we don't talk about it no.

[17:56:10:21]
Right we don't talk about it.

[17:56:12:11]
Just respectful.

[17:56:13:08]
Yeah.

[17:56:14:05]
Yes yes.

[17:56:14:21]
But as it but it's pretty neat that you always had a heart for Elvis.

[17:56:18:14]
Oh always.

[17:56:19:10]
Having grown up in Memphis right?

[17:56:20:10]
Yes always yes.

[17:56:21:10]
And then the person in Bob Joyce who seems to be very much similar to the person that we also love  Has really been another bright light for you again.

[17:56:33:15]
Oh a bright light yes.

[17:56:35:11]
I will tell you this because being from Memphis I've read most of the biography most of the books about Elvis.

[17:56:42:12]
And so I will say that there are so many similarities personality similarities physical there's just so much that you just sit back and say what a miracle it would be.

[17:57:00:06]
But if it's not then what a miracle that God has given this voice to another person.

[17:57:10:08]
Because even professionals they'll say "Oh my gosh that voice I know that voice."

[17:57:15:14]
And that God has given him that voice and he's using that voice.

[17:57:20:09]
And that was the thing that prompted the album is the world needs to hear this voice.

[17:57:26:11]
You know those people who loved Elvis and were fans will be so happy to hear that voice again.

[17:57:36:13]
And even the ones who might say oh you know you shouldn't try to copy it they will still hear that voice.

[17:57:44:23]
And it's very special.

[17:57:47:08]
And the next thing too is like at my age and maybe a little younger we can remember Elvis.

[17:57:56:09]
But and a lot of people are gone or don't have long to stay.

[17:58:03:14]
And just to think that this album is gonna put the voice back out there currently and to carry it on to say how special it is.

[17:58:14:16]
It's very special yeah.

[17:58:17:21]
He's a very special person.

[17:58:19:13]
Yeah and I like what you're saying that whether it is him or not it's the voice that people still know and love and loves their heart right?

[17:58:28:02]
And you get to hear it singing some of your favorite Christian songs yet again right?

[17:58:32:14]
Right yeah and some great new ones.

[17:58:34:15]
His songs are great.

[17:58:35:13]
The ones he's written are great.

[17:58:37:05]
Yeah.

[17:58:38:00]
Yeah.

[17:58:38:03]
Well if you could summarize Pastor Bob's message what would it be?

[17:58:44:10]
Hope encouragement healing love and a personal relationship with the Lord between you and the Lord.

[17:58:55:11]
Yeah and the Holy Spirit.

[17:58:59:05]
Yeah.

[17:59:02:16]
Pastor Bob is very special.

[17:59:13:10]
[LAUGH]

[17:59:15:20]
Understood understood.

[17:59:18:04]
I believe you gave me the same answer.

[17:59:19:12]
And we are very protective of him.

[17:59:22:10]
Yes yes as you should be.

[17:59:24:08]
And I think you both have accurately said it doesn't matter.

[17:59:29:01]
No it doesn't matter.

[17:59:30:01]
It's really it's exciting.

[17:59:32:11]
Yeah.

[17:59:32:23]
And it's fun when they can be two people who happen to represent the same qualities that you want to seek out in people and seek out in yourself right?

[17:59:42:14]
Yeah when we're spending time with him and his wife and at church the congregation I mean it's just a very bonding special time.

[17:59:51:20]
And so you don't just sit around thinking oh my gosh you know you just don't because you're so committed to the specialness of what's there.

[18:00:03:15]
Yeah so he's not busy covering anything up.

[18:00:06:03]
In fact he's living completely for Jesus.

[18:00:09:22]
Completely. then you get wrapped up in that enthusiasm.

[18:00:13:13]
Right.

[18:00:14:09]
And that magic right?

[18:00:14:16]
Yes exactly.

[18:00:16:09]
Yeah.

[18:00:17:05]
Mm-hmm.

[18:00:18:01]
Well you tell me that just so my voice won't be here but tell me more about being around him and being like I wanna hear about your sort of we certainly wanna promote the love that his friends have for him.

[18:00:30:08]
Yeah.

[18:00:31:20]
So when you're in and around Bob what's it like him and his wife what's it like?

[18:00:35:23]
Yeah it's well I'll tell you one thing. a lot of people say when you come to the church it's like you go back in time.

[18:00:46:06]
It's like church used to be.

[18:00:47:16]
It's not you know it's not like a running business.

[18:00:51:12]
It's not like a you know you don't know the past or you don't know.

[18:00:56:05]
It's very simple.

[18:00:57:16]
He's very special and intimate.

[18:01:01:00]
And that's because of his ministry I think and his wife.

[18:01:07:20]
It's just special being around them being with them.

[18:01:13:23]
And the church members too.

[18:01:15:21]
As I said before it starts out you go there for Pastor Bob for whatever reason obviously that's the draw.

[18:01:23:19]
But then once you're there it's like a whole different world opens up.

[18:01:30:10]
And you just have you know gosh I could name friends from so many states and countries and new phone numbers and people that connect and you know yeah it's special.

[18:01:41:19]
Nice.

[18:01:42:19]
How much did the how does the congregation get involved with the church?

[18:01:49:11]
Oh most of the congregation is always eager to work in the church to do whatever they can do you know to help and to contribute.

[18:02:00:12]
Yeah.

[18:02:01:08]
Yeah.

[18:02:02:04]
Yeah.

[18:02:03:00]
In a new organization.

[18:02:04:03]
Yeah.

[18:02:04:23]
Cool.

[18:02:05:19]
Anybody?

[18:02:06:22]
We got her here.

[18:02:08:12]
Who really wanted that?

[18:02:09:21]
Is the album available on vinyl?

[18:02:12:04]
The album is going to be available on vinyl.

[18:02:16:15]
Not right when it's launched but it is going to be available on vinyl.

[18:02:20:14]

[18:02:21:17]

[18:02:31:06]
Well congratulations.

[18:02:32:02]
We're really excited about the album.

[18:02:32:22]
Yeah and it's very special that he's trusted me with it.

[18:02:36:21]
Yeah.

[18:02:37:23]
Wow very cool.

[18:02:39:19]
I think that's it.

[18:02:40:15]
I think you did a wonderful job.

[18:02:41:12]
Okay.

[18:02:42:08]
Could have done better.

[18:02:44:18]
Oh my goodness. (laughing)  Okay.

[18:02:47:23]
All right.

[18:02:51:04]
Do you approve Steve?

[18:02:53:19]
Steve?

[18:02:55:04]
Steve?

[18:02:57:06]
Steve do you approve?

[18:02:59:13]
Do you approve?

[18:03:00:08]
[INTERPOSING VOICES] OK. [INTERPOSING VOICES]

[18:03:03:23]
All right.

[18:03:04:11]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

[18:03:05:08]
Wait wait wait.

[18:03:05:23]
There's an interesting question there.

[18:03:07:02]
Oh what?

[18:03:07:18]
What?

[18:03:08:06]
Sit down.

[18:03:08:18]
Sit down.

[18:03:09:06]
Uh-oh.

[18:03:09:18]
Wait what is it?

[18:03:10:20]
So I have a minute to think about it.

[18:03:12:11]
What was the question?

[18:03:13:12]
Well we started talking about what it was like having Bob in the studio.

[18:03:17:13]
How was Bob in the studio?

[18:03:20:11]
Oh yeah.

[18:03:21:17]
Bob was familiar with being in studios.

[18:03:23:01]
What was your take away of Bob's knowledge base in the studio?

[18:03:26:12]
How did he enjoy being there?

[18:03:28:10]
Tell me a little bit about that experience.

[18:03:30:19]
Bob Joyce knew exactly -- in his mind he had already worked out every song.

[18:03:35:11]
He knew exactly how he wanted it to be.

[18:03:38:05]
He knew exactly the octave he wanted.

[18:03:41:14]
He wanted to go up wherever he wanted.

[18:03:43:19]
And he would say to the musicians sometimes "Oh you played this in one key I want it here.

[18:03:50:15]
So he was he had it already fixed really how he wanted it and and I can tell you that John Hartley has done an amazing job capturing it the way Pastor Bob wanted it.

[18:04:00:07]
When I ask him are you pleased he gets a big smile on his face and says yeah it's gonna be good.

[18:04:05:04]
Yeah.

[18:04:06:09]
Did Bob share how he knows this much about music?

[18:04:09:15]
No he just now you know this is funny okay.

[18:04:13:06]
He's a country preacher right in Arkansas.

[18:04:16:22]
He's traveled the world knows many people from the past celebrities or otherwise from the past can tell you stories about them and he's you know just sits down and plays.

[18:04:31:03]
He doesn't talk about how he learned to play or where his talent comes from.

[18:04:36:21]
Yeah.

[18:04:37:21]
Do you see him disappear in his music a little bit?

[18:04:40:21]
Does he get lost in the moment?

[18:04:43:21]
Or is it just praise music and so it's very different?

[18:04:46:21]
Oh no it is a church service.

[18:04:49:21]
Yeah he is lost in his music.

[18:04:53:21]
Alright so out of the theories out there which ones do you think are the most fun?

[18:05:02:21]
Like which ones are you like oh that's that's a really good point.

[18:05:06:18]
Oh I don't know there's so many out there.

[18:05:10:08]
I don't even know if it's what's out there to me so much as having read so much and seen so many similarities in personality.

[18:05:23:09]
Yeah especially with your Memphis insight.

[18:05:27:08]
Right exactly.

[18:05:28:04]
You can't a person who is trying to be somebody else or remind somebody of somebody else can't stay they don't have everything every part of it.

[18:05:38:09]
But with Pastor Bob there are so many parts so many moving parts to it.

[18:05:45:03]
Just yeah.

[18:05:47:20]
That you can see why people might see the similarities.

[18:05:49:11]
Yeah that you can see why people see the similarities.

[18:05:52:16]
Yes.

[18:05:53:19]
Yeah yeah.

[18:05:55:16]
All right even though we won't put a percentage on it I think it's interesting that there are some interesting points of view out there.

[18:06:03:12]
Yeah.

[18:06:03:21]
All right.

[18:06:04:09]
Okay.

[18:06:04:21]
We good?

[18:06:05:09]
Yeah.

[18:06:05:21]
Excellent.

[18:06:06:09]
We're good.

[18:06:06:21]
Thank you very much.

[18:06:07:09]
Mm-hmm.

[18:06:07:21]
[APPLAUSE]

[18:06:09:09]
Oh good.

[18:06:09:21]
There's one story I was going to tell but not on camera.

[18:06:12:09]
Oh yeah.

[18:06:12:21]
I'll take that one in.

[18:06:13:09]
Always.

[18:06:13:21]
Always.

[18:06:14:09]
Always.

[18:06:14:21]
No yeah.

[18:06:15:09]
No we're not telling the best ones on camera are we?

[18:06:18:09]
[LAUGHTER]

[18:06:19:09]
Well what was that one?

[18:06:20:21]
I don't know.

[18:06:21:09]
I forgot it.

[18:06:22:09]
Oh.

[18:06:22:21]
[LAUGHTER]

[18:06:23:21]
All right.

[18:06:24:09]
I wish I hadn't moved around so much.

[18:06:28:09]
It was okay.

[18:06:30:14]
You won't let me look back.

[18:06:32:08]
What?

[18:06:36:08]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

[18:06:44:08]
So there's the frame.

[18:06:48:08]
And then this is at 8K. So odds are it's going to be more like that kind of thing.

[18:06:52:08]
Now you're looking up at someone.

[18:06:54:08]
The color is pretty.

[18:06:55:20]
It's beautiful right?

[18:06:57:08]
And you look fantastic.

[18:06:58:08]
Well done.

[18:06:59:08]
OK. Thank you.

[18:07:00:08]
Well done.

[18:07:00:20]
Wasn't it scary?

[18:07:01:08]
Thank you.

[18:07:02:08]
I wasn't scared.

[18:07:03:08]
I just wasn't prepared.

[18:07:05:08]
It's a different-- yeah.

[18:07:06:08]
[LAUGHTER]

[18:07:07:08]
Yeah.

[18:07:08:08]

Yeah.

[18:07:19:19]
Nice.

[18:07:20:07]

[18:07:21:07]
Do you want to take this off?

[18:07:22:14]
Yeah I'll get it.

[18:07:23:17]

Oh thank you.

[18:07:28:00]
OK. [INAUDIBLE]

[18:07:30:12]
I'm going to throw in the rig again.

[18:07:31:23]
Just going to get a couple of macro shots of some details out there.

[18:07:35:00]
Yep.

[18:07:35:12]
Would you grab two light stands out of the back of the car?

[18:07:40:00]
Yep.

[18:07:40:12]
The light aperture is right there.

[18:07:42:00]
Yep.

[18:07:42:12]
The lights are sitting right over there on the back.

[18:07:44:12]
There is a-- You sure? --bar up.

[18:07:49:23]
You understand what's at stake.

[18:07:52:23]
Is it okay?

[18:07:55:23]
Good.

[18:07:57:23]
Okay.

[18:07:59:23]
Yeah good.

[18:08:01:23]
Probably not to some people but I...

[18:08:03:23]
Is good?

[18:08:05:22]
Okay.

[18:08:05:23]
Yeah.

[18:08:07:22]
Good.

[18:08:09:22]
And you know the part about being healed from a sin?

[18:08:13:04]
It's true.

[18:08:13:22]
I can't...

[18:08:15:22]
Yeah.

[18:08:17:22]
It's true.

[18:08:18:18]
It comes in all shapes and sizes.

[18:08:20:00]
Mm-hmm.

[18:08:20:20]
If anything I'm gonna shoot this way.

[18:08:25:18]
Do it.

[18:08:26:14]
Mm-hmm.

[18:08:27:11]
Oh you are?

[18:08:28:07]
Oh push your heart.

[18:08:29:19]
Did I look okay though?

[18:08:30:20]
'Cause I don't look good when I talk on camera.

[18:08:33:06]
Oh don't show me I don't wanna see.

[18:08:34:18]
I told you there are reasons.

[18:08:35:21]
I was gonna say it to Rosie.

[18:08:36:17]
Is she sitting for you right now?

[18:08:37:21]
Oh well you can do that. (laughs) You can do that.

[18:08:41:02]
I wasn't gonna do it on purpose.

[18:08:42:13]
You can do that. (laughs)  What?

[18:08:45:05]
Gotta shut the window  She's gonna be covered black.

[18:08:48:08]
Oh okay.

[18:08:49:08]
What'd you think Brian?

[18:08:55:18]
I wish John was here to talk about the album.

[18:08:58:14]
He would have more like professional specifics about it.

[18:09:03:05]
We can do it with him anytime.

[18:09:04:12]
Yeah that's true we can.

[18:09:05:22]
Have you been able to connect with Matt?

[18:09:11:00]
Discipline?

[18:09:11:20]
Not yet.

[18:09:11:21]
Connect with Matt?

[18:09:13:21]
True I like it.

[18:09:13:21]
I told you that story.

[18:09:14:21]
Oh really?

[18:09:15:18]
I told you that story though with the filmmaker.

[18:09:17:17]
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's funny isn't it?

[18:09:23:17]
Yes you did.

[18:09:25:17]
DJ said I bet he had a hidden camera.

[18:09:27:17]
Oh you think?

[18:09:29:17]
Trying to get him on film.

[18:09:31:17]
He may have.

[18:09:33:17]
Yeah wow.

[18:09:33:17]
Well Gene Ho messaged me and said "Can you talk?"

[18:09:37:17]
And I said "Well I can't today but I can tomorrow but I'll talk to him tomorrow."

[18:09:42:17]
Because I told him at church I said "I've got a bone to pick with you."

[18:09:46:07]
Oh you did?

[18:09:47:07]
Yeah oh yeah yeah yeah.

[18:09:48:07]
How do you respond?

[18:09:49:07]
Oh he said "Okay tomorrow I said "if I can but maybe Tuesday."

[18:09:54:10]
So he already contacted me.

[18:09:55:17]
But I mean hey listen I just thought that that's crazy.

[18:10:00:22]
That's like free.

[18:10:01:22]
And again we're not looking to get in on the whole weekend.

[18:10:06:22]
We don't want to be behind the scenes.

[18:10:09:22]
Right.

[18:10:10:22]
Right.

[18:10:11:22]
Yeah.

[18:10:12:22]
Right.

[18:10:13:22]
Okay. [inaudible]

[18:10:15:22]
She got a steamer too.

[18:10:16:22]
She can steam it.

[18:10:17:22]
Well it'd be quicker to do it with a dryer.

[18:10:18:22]
As long as I don't think I'm going to lengthen the dryer.

[18:10:19:22]
Well it'll be by itself.

[18:10:20:22]
Okay.

[18:10:21:22]
Yeah sure. [inaudible]

[18:10:23:22]
There you go.

[18:10:24:22]
You built that by hand by the way.

[18:10:25:22]
Yeah that's right.

[18:10:26:22]
I was just sitting there with it so it gets a little bit better.

[18:10:33:21]
Y'all forgot to interview Teresa.

[18:10:36:21]
Tina take a seat. (laughing)  Teresa?

[18:10:42:11]
I thought I was too.

[18:10:47:01]
Actually this house the house I showed you is exactly laid out like this.

[18:10:59:18]
The living room's a lot smaller but the kitchen's bigger.

[18:11:03:14]
But it's very similar.

[18:11:06:14]
And that's what you wrote on your bag isn't it?

[18:11:08:19]
Yeah it's a little more narrow than that but about that long.

[18:11:12:10]
Well you could take that long and it's there.

[18:11:14:08]
Yes you could do the whole thing.

[18:11:16:03]
Bob is funny with women.

[18:11:19:00]
Yeah.

[18:11:20:02]
I didn't want to say that on camera.

[18:11:21:23]
Yeah he's very state-of-the-art.

[18:11:22:19]
Yeah.

[18:11:23:15]
And there in one sermon he said "I've always had trouble with women."

[18:11:26:07]
Right what pastor does that?

[18:11:27:03]
Yeah yeah.

[18:11:28:02]
The only way a woman can get close to Bob is if she has a husband with her.

[18:11:33:09]
Yep.

[18:11:34:19]
As a single woman I will only ever be Probably as close as I'll be.

[18:11:39:15]
Because when I said say to him thank you for trusting me he says I trust you.

[18:11:45:07]
But you're never gonna get show me with him.

[18:11:47:18]
Yeah does he ever call you himself?

[18:11:49:21]
Only a couple of times.

[18:11:52:17]
Yeah.

[18:11:53:13]
But not he doesn't yeah.

[18:11:55:07]
But it's because of the album.

[18:11:56:21]
Otherwise never.

[18:11:57:18]
It was business.

[18:11:58:14]
Yeah never.

[18:11:59:01]
It was business yeah.

[18:11:59:19]
Right never no.

[18:12:01:16]
Yeah one time we were arranging dinner okay?

[18:12:05:09]
And so Bob calls but it's well Lena's calling and she's calling me.

[18:12:10:05]
So I answer hello and he's like "This is Bob."

[18:12:15:05]
I said so it's not I thought it was Mrs. Joyce it's her mom.

[18:12:19:01]
Right.

[18:12:19:08]
He said "No it's Mr. Joyce emphasis on Mr."

[18:12:23:11]
Mr. Joyce.

[18:12:24:21]
I said "There's a song "Mr. Bossman."

[18:12:28:11]
I said "You ain't big you just tall."

[18:12:31:00]
You just tall that's all.

[18:12:32:16]
That's all.

[18:12:33:14]
So we throw these little things at him all the time.

[18:12:36:12]
We come down to the hotel in Franklin.

[18:12:40:06]
And it was early and Greg's how did that go?

[18:12:45:06]
How did that go about your knees your hands are shaking your knees are weak?

[18:12:51:18]
How did that go?

[18:12:52:14]
I just said "They sleep good."

[18:12:54:20]
And he said "Yeah."

[18:12:55:16]
And I said "Well I said something."

[18:13:00:16]
And Greg went and said-- Ask if you were nervous or something maybe.

[18:13:04:03]
I don't know it's just how he slept.

[18:13:05:21]
Yeah.

[18:13:06:17]
And I said something great.

[18:13:08:11]
How'd the song go?

[18:13:09:11]
I forget.

[18:13:10:07]
My hands are shaking my knees are weak.

[18:13:12:18]
Yeah.

[18:13:13:14]
How'd the song go?

[18:13:14:10]
I can't remember the song now.

[18:13:15:18]
I don't know he just laps it off and then he'll throw something in.

[18:13:20:17]
Thank you very much in here.

[18:13:22:06]
Yeah yeah.

[18:13:24:10]
Has he had work done?

[18:13:25:13]
Like yeah?

[18:13:27:01]
Oh yeah.

[18:13:27:21]
His face looks better now than it did four years ago.

[18:13:30:15]
I think he's still having some work.

[18:13:32:17]
Elvis had three nose jobs before he before 77.

[18:13:35:08]
But again like what local Arkansas pastor has that work done?

[18:13:39:05]
Cares cares.

[18:13:39:19]
That's the point.

[18:13:40:18]
When you meet him you're gonna say that's what I was telling you.

[18:13:43:22]
The fact that they say okay we're 72 or 70 no.

[18:13:48:17]
That to me is the biggest factor of all because he is obviously younger.

[18:13:53:19]
His skin is so much better now than he was.

[18:13:55:14]
Yeah.

[18:13:56:10]
I mean you look.

[18:13:56:21]
I don't know what he's doing.

[18:13:57:17]
He's doing something.

[18:13:58:13]
He is doing something.

[18:13:59:21]
Yeah we need to ask him don't we?

[18:14:01:21]
Before when we first met him you can zoom in and his pores are big on his nose.

[18:14:05:21]
Really?

[18:14:06:20]
Uh huh.

[18:14:06:21]
It's not anymore.

[18:14:07:21]
He would have some dark spots like I have.

[18:14:09:21]
Yeah.

[18:14:10:21]
He doesn't anymore.

[18:14:11:20]
It's probably microdermabrasion and stuff.

[18:14:13:20]
He's doing something and before Melina went tomorrow I'll go she went and had some filler show.

[18:14:19:20]
Yeah and she looks younger.

[18:14:21:20]
Yeah Bob may be getting some fillers.

[18:14:22:20]
He probably is.

[18:14:23:20]
Microdermabrasions or something.

[18:14:26:20]
Right yeah.

[18:14:27:20]
I don't know 'cause sometimes his skin does look red.

[18:14:32:00]
He might be using the retinol.

[18:14:33:14]
I mean I don't know what he's doing.

[18:14:34:22]
I told Patty to ask him "What are you doing Tristan?"

[18:14:38:05]
She said "What your skin?"

[18:14:39:02]
What you doing your skin?

[18:14:40:09]
What are you doing?

[18:14:42:01]
Right yeah it is yeah.

[18:14:45:04]
Yeah that's interesting.

[18:14:46:22]
But then Steve offers to fix that chip in his tooth but he won't do it.

[18:14:50:10]
He doesn't want it yeah.

[18:14:51:23]
I told him his pain was it didn't work.

[18:14:53:19]
Right yeah.

[18:14:54:16]
Yeah I've been buying a lot of pressure lobes.

[18:14:57:12]
I think it's a good idea.

[18:15:07:11]
I think it's a good idea.

[18:15:08:11]
The ones that have sweat just because I know that's somebody did this.

[18:15:11:11]
There's a picture on how to do it.

[18:15:13:11]
There's gazillion so pictures never since way up.

[18:15:15:11]
Yes right there.

[18:15:16:11]
Yeah let's see.

[18:15:17:11]
Oh yeah.

[18:15:18:11]
Elvis had that.

[18:15:19:11]
Yeah there it is.

[18:15:20:11]
Yeah I always had that condition.

[18:15:22:11]
And then if you look at the It's a website where people just can blog and have conversations.

[18:15:26:11]
A lot of stuff about Bob on there.

[18:15:28:11]
But one guy I tried to contact him.

[18:15:30:11]
I could not get his contact.

[18:15:32:11]
But he wrote a long post and he said "Listen I have been doing graphic design for 20 plus years worked with the universe sold work with all the big companies."

[18:15:41:11]
He said "I ran a digital face recognition program."

[18:15:45:11]
And he goes "Bob Joyce is as much is more Elvis than I am myself."

[18:15:51:10]
Really?

[18:15:52:07]
I've never seen that.

[18:15:53:01]
And he said "I'm sorry for whatever you believe."

[18:15:54:17]
He said "But..."

[18:15:55:13]
He said it downstairs.

[18:15:56:09]
He did?

[18:15:57:05]
He said "The data doesn't lie but I can't contact."

[18:15:59:19]
I had never tried because I've been afraid to.

[18:16:01:07]
Boy wouldn't that be great if you could talk to him?

[18:16:04:01]
Yeah.

[18:16:05:00]
Yeah.

[18:16:05:19]
That's amazing.

[18:16:06:15]
Did you hear what he said?

[18:16:07:22]
He put in a data guy put in facial recognition data and it came up that Bob Joyce's face is more Elvis than that guy is himself.

[18:16:16:23]
Didn't somebody say something?

[18:16:20:03]
I might have heard that they put his teeth over Steve's dead.

[18:16:24:08]
Steve's done that.

[18:16:25:03]
Yeah.

[18:16:25:15]
Well she's had blue eyes as well.

[18:16:27:03]
And he said-- And people said well you don't know where that picture came from so did you have to?

[18:16:30:22]
Oh yeah.

[18:16:31:10]
Now he's also had glaucoma.

[18:16:32:22]
And the eye drops actually do change eye color.

[18:16:35:12]
Plus age changes eye color.

[18:16:36:22]
Yeah age.

[18:16:37:15]
Yeah age.

[18:16:38:12]
And a lot of those pictures have him with bright blue eyes.

[18:16:41:10]
They're all photoshopped.

[18:16:42:17]
Yeah.

[18:16:43:05]
Yeah.

[18:16:43:17]
I mean especially now.

[18:16:44:19]
Yeah.

[18:16:45:07]
Look at old photos.

[18:16:45:22]
Of course.

[18:16:46:10]
Even the ones back then you mean.

[18:16:49:00]
His eyes weren't on some of his pictures.

[18:16:50:18]
Yeah they weren't.

[18:16:51:14]
No like that.

[18:16:52:10]
The color of your shirt.

[18:16:53:06]
No.

[18:16:54:02]
Some of them are now though.

[18:16:54:22]
Yeah.

[18:16:55:18]
Of the old Elvis.

[18:16:56:14]
When you find the young Elvis they were more hazel blue.

[18:16:59:00]
Yes.

[18:16:59:20]
Like these.

[18:17:00:15]
Like Bob's isn't it?

[18:17:01:12]
Like Bob's are now yeah.

[18:17:02:08]
I was watching the movies yesterday and his eyes were darker.

[18:17:05:15]
His eyes were darker than the 61 movies.

[18:17:08:15]
He probably had contacts in some of them.

[18:17:13:23]
What if Lisa Marie I mean not Lisa Marie (indistinct chatter)  Okay so there is a wedding picture.

[18:17:25:14]
It's Riley's wedding.

[18:17:27:20]
And there's a strange couple in the very end.

[18:17:30:19]
Have I showed you?

[18:17:31:15]
No.

[18:17:32:10]
Yes and I swear it's Bob and Marlena in costume.

[18:17:35:09]
Really?

[18:17:36:05]
Oh I wanna see that.

[18:17:37:10]
Can I show them in dark horse as far as the...

[18:17:39:23]
Oh show me anything.

[18:17:41:05]
It's fine yeah.

[18:17:42:08]
Show me anything.

[18:17:43:17]
Yeah.

[18:17:44:13]
This is mine.

[18:17:45:16]
I'll save it.

[18:17:46:19]
I'll be back.

[18:17:47:21]
Okay.

[18:17:48:13]
We'll water the water.

[18:17:50:11]
I'm not finished with it.

[18:17:52:14]
I just want to...

[18:17:57:00]
Oh no. [laughs] (sad music) [MUSIC] [MUSIC]

[18:18:22:20]
Watch this from here.

[18:18:24:20]
[MUSIC]

[18:18:30:20]
You're watching he gets into it he actually gets.

[18:18:33:20]
Let me see.

[18:18:35:20]
Part where his knee that's what I was gonna tell y'all.

[18:18:39:20]
What?

[18:18:40:20]
He gets his knee going around.

[18:18:41:20]
[MUSIC]

[18:18:51:20]
So John does not think it's Elvis?

[18:19:05:00]
John does I think.

[18:19:06:08]
He's not admitting it he doesn't think it's Elvis.

[18:19:08:05]
He thinks that it's some relative.

[18:19:10:12]
Yeah.

[18:19:11:03]
But I said well how do you explain all the physical?

[18:19:13:07]
The veins and the scar and the height and the suit size.

[18:19:15:19]
See Elvis is Elvis wears a size two of suit.

[18:19:19:08]
Everybody thinks he's 11 1/2 but I've got Elvis saying.

[18:19:22:05]
Probably but everybody says that could be better.

[18:19:26:02]
Excuse me.

[18:19:26:23]
'Cause he's 11 1/2 but I'll know where he's at.

[18:19:29:07]
Everything.

[18:19:30:03]
I know what I was gonna tell you a few minutes ago.

[18:19:31:11]
With all these things like the veins in the hands.

[18:19:33:20]
What's his name?

[18:19:35:23]
You know the the the the scar.

[18:19:37:22]
Like all that stuff can you point me in directions where all that's online so that I can pull that?

[18:19:43:07]
Well if you won't tell nobody where you got it I'll send it to you.

[18:19:48:22]
Yeah I think again you did you talk about it makes sense to have that stuff?

[18:19:52:09]
I got all that stuff.

[18:19:54:02]
Is this mine?

[18:19:55:19]
Just put your download in on the demo?

[18:19:58:03]
Yeah just do it.

[18:19:59:14]
Now I want you to look at this right here.

[18:20:02:08]
You look at this eye okay and look at the fat pocket and the crow's feet.

[18:20:05:10]
Okay Elvis had crow's feet when he was young all right?

[18:20:08:04]
And you come over here and look at Elvis's end match up identical okay of course everything else matches up identical about that picture including this tooth that's weird not this I choose but behind there's shaped exactly the same and then you know you look at like I said the hands I've got tons you know but you just can't make that up man they're gonna stop in the near future because you can offer.

[18:20:34:05]
Can you find it?

[18:20:35:07]
Yeah I'm gonna look up something else.

[18:20:37:03]
They're gonna start scanning this.

[18:20:38:07]
She said it could be this.

[18:20:39:04]
That would be easier too.

[18:20:40:08]
This is this.

[18:20:41:12]
Yeah.

[18:20:42:08]
So.

[18:20:43:04]
I'm gonna have a center one girl.

[18:20:46:23]
And those are not the same exactly as far as it's just like the ones he used to use.

[18:20:54:09]
I'll let you do that you know.

[18:20:56:09]
Of course I got more.

[18:20:58:09]
See right here that's where I took the picture.

[18:21:00:19]
Yep.

[18:21:01:15]
I'll put a picture of it in the casket.

[18:21:05:07]
Well that makes total sense like you were saying.

[18:21:06:20]
That looks like Elvis what 20 years earlier?

[18:21:09:09]
Yeah yeah there's a picture of it.

[18:21:10:09]
So if it would have been a wax figure who was it?

[18:21:14:22]
It was Gene Smith right?

[18:21:17:16]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

[18:21:19:15]
It's on that little video right there.

[18:21:22:22]
Gene Smith's sale.

[18:21:23:18]
Which he knew of right?

[18:21:27:22]
Oh yeah he made it all this stuff.

[18:21:30:22]
[ Inaudible ]

[18:21:53:22]
I know what I was going to tell you a few minutes ago.

[18:21:56:12]
One day he got up from music practice and Greg turned on one of the singers turned on a fast Christian song by somebody else.

[18:22:05:09]
He got out in the middle of the floor and danced for us.

[18:22:07:16]
Did his little leg jig and he said "I can still do it."

[18:22:10:17]
Walked away.

[18:22:11:13]
I was like "Great."

[18:22:13:07]
It was like "Whoa."

[18:22:14:03]
I think he said "I still got it."

[18:22:15:12]
I still got it.

[18:22:16:08]
That's what he said "I still got it."

[18:22:18:05]
Yeah I still got it.

[18:22:19:05]
That's what he said.

[18:22:20:02]
I still got it.

[18:22:21:00]
Yeah.

[18:22:23:05]
I can't find it.

[18:22:25:00]
You can't find it?

[18:22:25:20]
I found the picture.

[18:22:27:20]
I wanted to make sure it wasn't his parents.

[18:22:29:20]
Her husband is a stuntman.

[18:22:37:20]
Really?

[18:22:39:20]
Okay.

[18:22:41:20]
When did they get married?

[18:22:45:20]
[indistinct chatter]

[18:22:48:20]
What do we know about her?

[18:22:50:20]
What did she say about her background?

[18:22:52:19]
She said she was in California which I was in the news about.

[18:22:55:19]
You know a little landmine.

[18:22:56:19]
Um can I grab that blanket out of the dryer?

[18:22:59:19]
Oh there you go.

[18:23:00:19]
Is that all right?

[18:23:01:19]
Mm-hmm.

[18:23:02:19]
There's just no way.

[18:23:06:19]
There's just no way.

[18:23:08:19]
You're from Rosie?

[18:23:11:19]
Yeah.

[18:23:12:19]
What'd she say?

[18:23:13:19]
No way.

[18:23:14:19]
Oh no.

[18:23:17:02]
I always look so bad when I'm talking.

[18:23:19:19]
Oh I didn't even send him anything.

[18:23:22:19]
Thank you.

[18:23:24:19]
Okay.

[18:23:29:19]
I'm on a hunt.

[18:23:31:19]
This is what I do.

[18:23:32:19]
This is what I do.

[18:23:34:18]
So they were saying they don't want to come surprise in a real planet Not surprised no You don't like surprises Don't think they've gotten there yet they're trying to line up to talk to Matt I think He was living with them but he's also spending like three weeks at a time in Franklin He's doing some recording stuff So you actually think it was maybe them in disguise  Dusters.

[18:24:35:04]
Dusters.

[18:24:36:00]
Yeah.

[18:24:36:20]
The macro lens.

[18:24:38:00]
You can type in his name and his family and Patterson Smith's family or whatever his name is.

[18:24:48:23]
You'll see stuff on there and you'll go back to find it and it's disappeared so many times.

[18:24:53:22]
Lately.

[18:24:54:18]
You found that to be tapping?

[18:24:56:16]
Yeah these things the reason why I shot those interviews was that these open up to a 1.5 so they're extremely fast so I got a nice shallow depth. shallow depth and that's why I can also just deal with what's the natural lens.

[18:25:11:07]
So this is a RF mount this is an EF lens.

[18:25:15:08]
And then what I like about this one in particular is that it's a built in ND.

[18:25:22:16]
So that way I can...

[18:25:25:11]
I probably removed it.

[18:25:26:11]
Well lens is one of the six to the 600 but it's a signal because a Nikon lens like that would be 20000.

[18:25:34:05]
I don't make that much money shooting away also.

[18:25:36:11]
Right. (laughing)  I spent 25 months off so it ended up working good.

[18:25:41:02]
Now if I was doing it for a living I'd do the exact same thing you all do.

[18:25:47:02]
See these Snoopy O'Longs I mean I've got it'd be really neat to be able to go through [ Inaudible ]

[18:26:17:16]
Is that the RCA files?
