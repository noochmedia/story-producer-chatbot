[07:44:40:13]
I go to First Baptist Church in Cabot.

[07:44:45:20]
I also like to do Rubik's Cubes I do a lot of puzzles.

[07:44:51:11]
I hang out with my friends sometimes.

[07:44:56:11]
That's about all.

[07:44:58:11]
Do you drive again?

[07:44:59:11]
Yes I am.

[07:45:00:11]
All right.

[07:45:03:11]
Tell us about how each of you first found out about these online theories about your grandfather.

[07:45:15:11]
Well I saw I kind of heard about it along the way from my grandparents and I kind of saw a few videos.

[07:45:26:01]
Like I go to a church a few times a lot of times actually and I just kind of heard about it.

[07:45:34:12]
I just kind of picked up on it sort of because they would always talk about it with each other at the house.

[07:45:40:01]
And then And then eventually I started seeing videos of it on the internet.

[07:45:45:03]
Like one really really big video.

[07:45:47:03]
It had like a little over a million views on it.

[07:45:52:03]
And that's when I kind of knew that people thought he was Elvis.

[07:45:56:03]
Do your friends know about these videos?

[07:45:59:03]
A few of them.

[07:46:01:03]
They kind of pick it up on TikTok. (indistinct chatter)  She always does.

[07:46:19:11]
You guys by the way too like while he's asking questions feel free it's happening you can jump in you can talk you know it can be just very casual.

[07:46:26:04]
I'm trying to think of things.

[07:46:27:14]
Okay.

[07:46:28:10]
I'm trying to think of things.

[07:46:29:06]
Okay.

[07:46:30:02]
Processing it.

[07:46:30:22]
I understand. (dog barking) I know it's intimidating behind the camera just for yourself.

[07:46:37:00]
Little bit and then those two people.

[07:46:39:04]
The dogs.

[07:46:42:21]
Right?

[07:46:44:03]
Everybody's all ramped up.

[07:46:45:17]
What kind of how would you describe your reference?

[07:46:50:17]
I mean my Mimi?

[07:46:55:08]
Well wait should I say that or should I say her name?

[07:46:58:02]
Mimi.

[07:46:58:22]
Okay well my Mimi is pretty sweet to other people she's mainly pretty outgoing but when it comes to being at the church she kinda guides it down.

[07:47:10:04]
And my papa obviously is the pastor so he's moving through people's lives and that's really all that matters.

[07:47:19:01]
Well how come I mean how are they with you?

[07:47:21:21]
Are they involved?

[07:47:22:17]
Just with me?

[07:47:22:17]
Do they go to school?

[07:47:25:03]
Well we go to their house a lot.

[07:47:26:22]
They don't really come to events but whenever we were littler We used to do a grandparents day at our school and they come to that a lot.

[07:47:36:03]
So they go to big events like whenever I was in drum line at my school a long time ago they go to those and watch me play.

[07:47:45:10]
So they're just always there for major things.

[07:47:47:22]
What do you think Ren?

[07:47:48:22]
What do you do at the church there?

[07:47:49:22]
Do you ever help out there do you ever work there?

[07:47:54:22]
What do you like to do over there?

[07:47:57:17]
Oh me?

[07:47:58:22]
Yup.

[07:47:59:22]
Sometimes I think I just hang out on Sunday school most of the time.

[07:48:06:22]
I don't really listen.

[07:48:08:22]
I mean I think I've listened to his sermons once or twice but otherwise I don't really spend a lot of time in service.

[07:48:16:22]
I just kind of sit back there with the other kids and learn the lesson in there.

[07:48:22:22]
He spends a lot of time in the classroom.

[07:48:24:22]
Yeah.

[07:48:25:22]
Yeah it's been.

[07:48:26:22]
How are your grandparents?

[07:48:28:22]
How would you describe your grandparents?

[07:48:30:21]
Well I'd say I'm my grandma's favorite.

[07:48:35:21]
So she likes to take me places.

[07:48:38:21]
We just talk a lot about really anything.

[07:48:45:21]
And then my grandpa.

[07:48:46:21]
I mean he hangs out a lot where we are but he doesn't really talk much at the house.

[07:48:59:14]
He just kind of works like he cooks stuff.

[07:49:02:14]
That's all I can say about my grandpa really.

[07:49:06:14]
You don't talk to him much.

[07:49:07:14]
I'm his favorite so it makes it easy.

[07:49:11:14]
What did you tell your grandfather about?

[07:49:13:14]
Well he likes to  he asked me about stuff like what I've been doing lately.

[07:49:22:14]
Like he asked how my drumming's been going or how my week was stuff like that.

[07:49:29:13]
Otherwise it's not really much.

[07:49:31:13]
Whenever I'm around I don't go over as much as he does but whenever I do Like he says he just works and stuff so he doesn't talk as much.

[07:49:43:13]
But whenever he does talk he likes talking about how our week was what we've done so far and what we're planning to do and he asks simple questions like that.

[07:49:56:13]
And then once every now and then he'll play a game with us like cards or board game they have in their closet stuff like that.

[07:50:04:13]
Yeah so you gotta tell me so kids at school they've caught on to this conspiracy theory?

[07:50:11:09]
A little bit yeah.

[07:50:13:06]
What do they have to say about it?

[07:50:16:01]
Well a lot of them have talked about how they've seen his videos.

[07:50:20:06]
I told a couple people at first about him my close friends.

[07:50:24:20]
And so they kind of caught on with that and they got the idea of it.

[07:50:29:09]
And then they started seeing the videos and coming up to me and asking me is it really true?

[07:50:33:22]
and I'm telling them no because it's not but yeah.

[07:50:38:22]
It's around the same thing for me.

[07:50:41:00]
I mean they come across a video some of my friends will send me like a video of it and they'll be like is this your grandpa?

[07:50:48:01]
Yeah that's my grandpa.

[07:50:50:13]
And he's been around for a little bit on the internet now.

[07:50:55:15]
A couple of people have told us well me I'm not sure about him about how he showed up at Elvis's daughter's funeral.

[07:51:04:18]
I forgot her name.

[07:51:07:11]
But yeah which that also isn't true.

[07:51:11:09]
So do kids do they all think he's Elvis or do they all kind of blow out of the city?

[07:51:20:22]
Not all of them no.

[07:51:22:07]
Most of them blow out of the city yeah.

[07:51:25:03]
Because I mean it's ridiculous.

[07:51:28:13]
We'd be 90 years old.

[07:51:30:22]
That's ridiculous.

[07:51:33:04]
Yeah.

[07:51:34:00]
Do you think it's funny when kids talk too bad or is it kind of annoying?

[07:51:39:10]
Little bit of both.

[07:51:41:04]
I like to tell them all about it.

[07:51:42:06]
I don't.

[07:51:43:02]
It's dumb common sense.

[07:51:45:14]
How would a good friend of yours really feel?

[07:51:53:18]
What was that?

[07:51:54:14]
(laughing) (laughing)  I wouldn't believe it.

[07:52:04:14]
I wouldn't even think he's crazy. (laughing) Not real.

[07:52:12:14]
God insane.

[07:52:14:07]
So do kids at school know you guys as the one with the famous TikTok grandfather?

[07:52:22:21]
Not as much.

[07:52:26:10]
They know about it but that's not how they know us.

[07:52:29:08]
Yeah.

[07:52:30:02]
It's not this overdrying problem.

[07:52:32:05]
They don't ever really talk about it except for the first time that they've seen it.

[07:52:37:10]
Have you ever been out with your grandparent somewhere probably at a restaurant or something and someone says something that recognizes them?

[07:52:44:07]
Yeah.

[07:52:44:21]
Yeah.

[07:52:45:09]
Tell us about that.

[07:52:46:12]
Actually we went to the beach one time in Alabama and we're just sitting in a restaurant we're eating. and a couple ladies come up to him and ask him are you Bob Joyce?

[07:52:58:12]
And then he's I can't remember.

[07:53:01:02]
He was saying I think he said yes I am or something like that.

[07:53:04:17]
And he they asked to take a picture with him and it was just crazy because I didn't really think someone in Alabama would know about him.

[07:53:14:10]
And yeah.

[07:53:16:18]
Just a couple of weeks ago he went to get a car wash and we were out to eat Chick-fil-A I think.

[07:53:24:18]
And this guy in the window he said that he recognized him from one of his videos.

[07:53:33:02]
And he was a big fan.

[07:53:36:01]
I guess he listened a lot to it.

[07:53:37:14]
Well we're driving off and he says "Love your videos by the way."

[07:53:42:21]
That made me start laughing.

[07:53:44:15]
And how did you react when he saw it?

[07:53:49:02]
He just kinda says "Oh okay."

[07:53:49:23]
He kind of laughs it off.

[07:53:51:05]
Thank you thank you.

[07:53:52:05]
He'll laugh it off you know.

[07:53:55:14]
He'll say thank you.

[07:53:56:15]
Not much of anything.

[07:53:59:21]
He'll appreciate it I guess yeah.

[07:54:02:06]
Have you ever played music with him?

[07:54:04:17]
Well.

[07:54:05:14]
I've considered it.

[07:54:06:12]
I play piano just like he does.

[07:54:08:21]
So whenever he comes over for Christmas Thanksgiving all that he teaches me something and we'll just kind of play what we both know.

[07:54:16:02]
I could be possibly drumming for his church a few times maybe.

[07:54:24:21]
Yeah that's about it.

[07:54:28:11]
That's all I do.

[07:54:29:04]
Nice yeah you good?

[07:54:32:11]
Anything else you wanna say Ryan?

[07:54:35:06]
He's a great man not Elvis.

[07:54:38:01]
[LAUGH]

[07:54:41:06]
All right awesome you guys killed it.

[07:54:43:15]
Thank you so much.

[07:54:44:11]
Great.

[07:54:45:01]
Great job.

[07:54:45:11]
What do you want me to do with this?

[07:54:46:06]
You'll take it from me.

[07:54:48:01]
Got it.

[07:54:48:21]
