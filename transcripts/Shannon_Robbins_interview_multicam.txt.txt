As much as I can come.

[15:38:42:05]
Not as much as I would like but as much as I can come.

[15:38:45:05]
When did you first find out about the church down here?

[15:38:52:05]
Mid 2020.

[15:38:53:05]
What happened?

[15:38:55:05]
Well my mom had been watching and she...

[15:39:00:05]
Online right?

[15:39:01:05]
Online yes.

[15:39:02:05]
So she had mentioned it to us and so she wanted to come so I brought her.

[15:39:08:05]
We made a weekend of it.

[15:39:10:05]
So we made some friends.

[15:39:13:05]
Did you see Yeah when she showed me yeah but I hadn't seen it she spends a lot of time on her phone I was like wow No a sermon I hadn't seen any of his music but it was his sermon But it also wasn't one of these conspiracy theory videos.

[15:39:39:08]
It was just him.

[15:39:41:08]
And was the wow because of his preaching?

[15:39:44:08]
It was both.

[15:39:46:08]
He's relatable.

[15:39:49:08]
He's very relatable.

[15:39:50:08]
And what was your mom's interest?

[15:39:55:07]
Well Elvis of course.

[15:39:59:07]
So you two took a trip down here?

[15:40:03:07]
Well it was me my mom a friend and his two daughters.

[15:40:08:07]
So we made a weekend trip out of it and did some sightseeing and then.

[15:40:15:10]
And so what was your reaction the first time you attended the church?

[15:40:18:09]
Just like everybody else that goes through the door.

[15:40:22:13]
Really?

[15:40:23:07]
Yeah.

[15:40:23:10]
It's that transformative huh?

[15:40:25:21]
Mm-hmm.

[15:40:26:17]
Okay.

[15:40:27:02]
Yeah.

[15:40:27:22]
Nice.

[15:40:28:18]
Just when he spoke just you felt welcome.

[15:40:32:04]
He looked into your soul instead of.

[15:40:35:07]
Tell me that forever.

[15:40:36:05]
What's the first time you met Pastor Brian?

[15:40:38:20]
It was in October of 2020 and he just he well it just he just looked through your soul.

[15:40:50:14]
He looked through you to to see why you were there.

[15:40:55:01]
That's what I thought.

[15:40:57:05]
It was amazing.

[15:41:01:06]
I don't keep up.

[15:41:04:05]
I just come as often as I can.

[15:41:10:17]
We stay with friends.

[15:41:12:19]
What do you think about the what do you think of the theories?

[15:41:19:12]
I mean let me ask you straight out do you think he's Elvis Presley?

[15:41:23:05]
I do.

[15:41:24:11]
Okay.

[15:41:24:15]
But it doesn't matter to me because that's that's all why I come now because there's a family out here that that we get to see when we come.

[15:41:36:04]
So tell me about the group that you amazing.

[15:41:39:14]
They're all amazing.

[15:41:41:00]
They're special.

[15:41:42:07]
Welcoming.

[15:41:46:19]
Say they don't judge anybody.

[15:41:52:07]
You just are who you are with them.

[15:41:55:00]
That's pretty amazing.

[15:41:56:21]
Is the whole church congregation that way?

[15:42:00:02]
Yes.

[15:42:00:14]
Yeah some of them was a little more guarded at the beginning but after two or three times they're just now it's just I'm so glad to see you and can't wait for you to come back.

[15:42:17:08]
Has your mom been back?

[15:42:18:17]
She has.

[15:42:19:18]
She didn't get to come as much as I do.

[15:42:23:15]
But she she's not convinced 100%.

[15:42:30:03]
But So what's your relationship with Pastor Bob now?

[15:42:40:10]
It's good.

[15:42:41:10]
We get to see him on the weekends when we're here and have dinner with him.

[15:42:46:13]
He's just a person and that's what he wants to be is just a person in my opinion.

[15:42:53:13]
He wants you to know the Lord and get to know the Lord if you don't.

[15:43:00:15]
Do you like that this Elvis story is attracting people to then hear the word?

[15:43:07:13]
I do but it worries me for him.

[15:43:13:16]
Because if he is Elvis he left that life. will there'll be a lot more people come for him instead of for the word so but if he can change one that's all it matters But if it's him it's him.

[15:43:47:02]
I never knew Elvis so I was little you know and so if it is then great.

[15:43:54:22]
I got to know a great man now not then.

[15:44:00:22]
If you could summarize Pastor Bob's message what would it be?

[15:44:08:22]
Touching.

[15:44:09:22]
Say that again?

[15:44:10:22]
Touching.

[15:44:11:22]
Touching.

[15:44:12:22]
But what's the even more so than that what's the theme of his sermons?

[15:44:16:22]
You have to say these are the types of things that Pastor Bob speaks about.

[15:44:19:21]
He's so relatable in his sermons.

[15:44:22:21]
It touches you no matter what he's preaching about.

[15:44:25:21]
You can relate to him.

[15:44:27:21]
He has a way of wording his sermons so you can understand him so you can feel the power.

[15:44:40:21]
[ Silence ]

[15:44:42:21]
It's great.

[15:44:44:21]
It's good.

[15:44:46:21]
Have you ever played the game "Pyramid" where you only say one word at a time?

[15:44:49:21]
No.

[15:44:50:21]
Yeah you'd be great at it.

[15:44:51:21]
[ Laughter ]

[15:44:55:21]
Honestly it's fantastic.

[15:44:57:21]
I think you did great.

[15:44:59:21]
I think you looked fantastic.

[15:45:01:20]
I think it was super fun.

[15:45:02:20]
So appreciate it.

[15:45:03:20]
Any fun stories about you and Pastor Bob you'd want to tell?

[15:45:06:20]
No.

[15:45:07:20]
No.

[15:45:08:20]
[ Laughter ]

[15:45:09:20]
No.

[15:45:10:08]
Not a one.

[15:45:10:23]
Not a one.

[15:45:12:03]
