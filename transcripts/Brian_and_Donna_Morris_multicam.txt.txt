[12:33:04:12]
A speeds B speeds.

[12:33:07:12]
Alright first and foremost can we see the slate up?

[12:33:11:12]
Go ahead and open up the clapper there and tell us your names.

[12:33:16:12]
Brian and Donna Morris.

[12:33:19:12]
Nicely done.

[12:33:25:12]
Brian and Donna where do you guys currently reside?

[12:33:29:12]
In Hot Springs Arkansas.

[12:33:31:12]
Okay.

[12:33:32:00]
All right.

[12:33:33:01]
And how how may I ask did you arrive in hot springs?

[12:33:36:22]
It was uh it was definitely a guide God guiding thing.

[12:33:42:20]
Okay.

[12:33:48:03]
Okay. (inaudible) You already answered the Hot Springs Arkansas one so you want to do it again?

[12:34:13:16]
Well we prayed to God for direction in life because we wanted a new chapter in life and It basically was revealed to us and we are totally blessed to have this property that we're at and we feel it was God's path.

[12:34:48:04]
So to back up slightly where were you when you were praying?

[12:34:51:07]
Kona Hawaii.

[12:34:54:05]
So you were living in Kona Hawaii and what happened?

[12:34:57:18]
We basically after COVID we just wanted a new change in life.

[12:35:03:11]
My father passed away so we were just looking for new direction and stuff so we decided to travel take a year off and Seeking for a property to purchase and in the meantime we just kept praying about it and We ended up in Hot Springs Arkansas So actually like you saying we were in Kona Hawaii and we actually sold our house both of our businesses everything that we owned.

[12:35:32:00]
We packed up a U-Haul pod and started out in Washington State bought an RV and a truck and just went on God's path.

[12:35:40:00]
He guided us everywhere we went.

[12:35:41:08]
We didn't make a plan for the next place we were gonna stop except for to stop in Hot Springs and see Pastor Bob again.

[12:35:50:09]
And we loved it.

[12:35:52:07]
It just felt like home and so we stayed.

[12:35:54:16]
How did you first hear about Pastor Bob?

[12:35:56:16]
I heard online somebody posted on Facebook and I was interested so I decided to check it out a little bit more and I got more interested and just kept watching the videos and and then I found his website and started watching the sermons and then I got Brian to start watching the sermons and then we made a plan to stop by and visit.

[12:36:20:00]
Now at that point when you thought about going to visit Were you was it still the allure of who Pastor Bob might be?

[12:36:27:23]
Or at that point was it something different?

[12:36:31:02]
Of course you know when you're watching all those other videos on YouTube and everything you know you are curious.

[12:36:36:12]
Very curious.

[12:36:37:15]
Yep and originally we had planned on stopping by on our way to Minnesota for a visit.

[12:36:44:05]
And we'd been trying to get married for a couple of years.

[12:36:46:21]
And as we were planning the trip I was like "Well you know he's my pastor.

[12:36:52:15]
I've been watching him online for almost two years.

[12:36:54:22]
Maybe he'll marry us So I sent him an email and gave him a little history about us and he answered me back very quickly and said as long as you're Coming here for the right reasons.

[12:37:03:20]
I'd be honored to marry you and if you have Jesus in your heart.

[12:37:07:04]
Yeah Which we do So we got there and you know as soon as I walked in and looked in his eyes I knew there was something very special there Yes It was amazing.

[12:37:24:12]
I mean we were both just I Had been watching him online But to actually be there in person and feel his energy and his positive energy for God It was it was absolutely amazing Like I said when I looked into his eyes I knew there was something really special there The longer you've been around him does it matter to you?

[12:37:56:18]
It does not.

[12:37:57:18]
No not in the least bit.

[12:37:59:04]
He has brought more Jesus into my heart than I've ever had in my life.

[12:38:03:17]
Absolutely.

[12:38:04:17]
When I lived in California I belonged to a church I was baptized but I hadn't been to a church in a long time at least 15 years and I want to be there every Sunday.

[12:38:18:11]
I want to hear what Pastor Bob has to say.

[12:38:21:18]
He speaks to our heart every time that we're there.

[12:38:23:20]
We get a message that we're supposed to have.

[12:38:25:20]
He's amazing.

[12:38:26:20]
So during COVID were you seeking church?

[12:38:29:20]
Were you seeking the Word or were you just did you get bathed in by the conspiracy theory?

[12:38:39:04]
It was before COVID that I started watching the sermons.

[12:38:44:03]
COVID you know I think that it was we were searching for something.

[12:38:50:13]
Yeah.

[12:38:51:08]
We needed something.

[12:38:51:23]
Just didn't know it was something wasn't a fit.

[12:38:54:04]
And we're just looking for that piece of the puzzle.

[12:38:57:16]
Right.

[12:38:58:04]
Everybody talks about manifesting your realities and doing all this.

[12:39:01:19]
I was looking at all kinds of different avenues to to complete our lives to bring something into our lives that we really needed.

[12:39:08:09]
And you know I first thought it was the house.

[12:39:10:13]
Then I thought it was the business. and it was something spiritual.

[12:39:14:17]
It was God's Word is what we needed.

[12:39:17:10]
I'll tell you about the congregation tell me about the family there.

[12:39:21:06]
Oh absolutely.

[12:39:22:15]
Wonderful friends.

[12:39:24:03]
Great to have around being surrounded as positive energy.

[12:39:27:18]
You can tell that they're all been blessed by God the way their spirits shine.

[12:39:35:03]
And just to hear the Word of the Lord together is very awesome.

[12:39:39:23]
How does it differ from other churches you've been to?

[12:39:42:23]
The closeness and like the real love I believe with everybody in there.

[12:39:47:23]
Stronger bond.

[12:39:48:23]
Yes yeah.

[12:39:49:23]
It's a very close-knit church.

[12:39:51:23]
Have you brought a leader for the church?

[12:39:56:23]
Absolutely.

[12:39:57:23]
Every chance we get.

[12:39:59:23]
Okay.

[12:40:00:23]
And how do you go about that?

[12:40:01:23]
Do you tell them because of Pastor Bob do you send them down the rabbit hole on YouTube?

[12:40:06:23]
What do you tend to do?

[12:40:07:22]
I think it depends on who we're talking to.

[12:40:12:12]
My friend Lance was blown away by his preaching.

[12:40:15:05]
He's been to many churches and stuff before but told me that he felt the Holy Spirit work through him to Lance and just opened up his heart even bigger.

[12:40:26:18]
He was really amazed by that.

[12:40:29:08]
My daughter was actually here visiting from Washington a couple of weeks ago and she was here last year visiting and went to church with us and she's you know she hasn't been as close with Jesus as she should be until she came last year and since then she's been practicing reading the Word getting much closer with Jesus and she was baptized this last time that she came to visit and you know I it's just changed her life and she you know she she gives it to Pastor Bob she said that she's never seen anybody full of so much love and light.

[12:41:05:00]
So now knowing him as well as you do now now members of the church do you still think about who he might have been?

[12:41:11:00]
No.

[12:41:13:04]
I look at Matt as a different person.

[12:41:15:10]
He's so humble.

[12:41:17:14]
His heart is so huge.

[12:41:20:11]
And you feel it.

[12:41:22:00]
That's really cool.

[12:41:25:23]
How often do you guys go to church?

[12:41:29:23]
Every Sunday.

[12:41:31:23]
Occasionally missed but yeah.

[12:41:34:06]
Occasionally missed because of you know certain events that unfold.

[12:41:38:14]
Well one of the things I heard especially even last night the album release party is that people are so upset when they do miss.

[12:41:44:13]
And I'm not aware of any other church in America.

[12:41:47:13]
Someone says "I can't believe I missed church."

[12:41:49:13]
Like "I missed out."

[12:41:50:13]
Tell me what that feeling is.

[12:41:52:13]
You do.

[12:41:53:13]
You do feel like you miss out.

[12:41:54:13]
There's always something.

[12:41:55:13]
You know you'll go back and you'll watch the video and he's talking again about something that's just touching your heart. and you want to be there in the midst of that.

[12:42:03:17]
You want to feel that energy coming off of His body when He's preaching.

[12:42:07:23]
And you know it's always a good sermon.

[12:42:10:00]
So we do miss out and we miss out on friends people that come to visit and it's hard.

[12:42:15:18]
People that come to that church are amazing.

[12:42:17:18]
And the greatest thing about being online is if you do miss that church sermon you actually can go there and watch it again but it is not the same.

[12:42:25:14]
There's the power and the energy of the Holy Spirit. it's just not the same online.

[12:42:30:18]
Are you involved at all with the construction of the new property?

[12:42:35:13]
Yes.

[12:42:36:09]
Okay tell me about that.

[12:42:38:08]
Basically we're just waiting for the temperature to cool down a little bit.

[12:42:42:04]
I have a tractor with you know certain attachments to it.

[12:42:45:04]
And so we're gonna start cleaning up some property stuff whatever they need me to do I'll lend a hand.

[12:42:55:20]
So what happened there?

[12:42:57:02]
the other church think you're out of it?

[12:42:59:16]
Growing pains.

[12:43:01:02]
Serious growing pains.

[12:43:03:01]
Growing pains.

[12:43:03:01]
Yeah we decided that we're coming to church before the doors open so that we can get a seat.

[12:43:09:16]
There's overflow in the fellowship hall so that gets packed as well.

[12:43:14:13]
And it's unfortunate people come a long way to listen to Pastor Bob preach.

[12:43:19:02]
And when they can't be front and center to see that and experience that in person it's kind of sad. be nice when they open the new doors.

[12:43:27:05]
What time does church start on Sunday?

[12:43:29:05]
The doors open at 9 and it starts at 10.

[12:43:31:05]
What time do you have to get there to get a seat?

[12:43:33:05]
That's a secret. [laughter]

[12:43:37:05]
But fairly early is that what we understand?

[12:43:40:04]
Yes.

[12:43:41:04]
Before the doors open.

[12:43:43:05]
If you're a regular member that lives there and comes every Sunday then yeah you need to get there before the doors open.

[12:43:48:04]
Especially if you want a good parking spot.

[12:43:50:04]
Yes.

[12:43:51:04]
You could be parked half a mile down the road.

[12:43:54:04]
How do you guys see the church grow since you started attending?

[12:43:59:04]
It's grown quite a bit.

[12:44:03:04]
It's always changing.

[12:44:05:04]
So you know you have your main people there and then all of a sudden you get some more visitors from the state next door and now they're coming up every Sunday or every other Sunday.

[12:44:16:04]
And so yeah it just keeps growing.

[12:44:19:04]
It's beautiful.

[12:44:21:03]
When you look at your story in parallel with other people on how this church seems to be drawn to from all corners of the earth can you talk about that a little bit?

[12:44:31:04]
I just think it's coming from online and the people wanna come experience it for theirself.

[12:44:37:14]
I'm sure there's a lot of people sharing.

[12:44:39:10]
I believe a lot of it has to do with God.

[12:44:42:00]
God has got a plan for them and wants them to experience this certain situation in this church and I believe it changes them.

[12:44:51:00]
Yeah one of the things is you know people may come for a different reason in the beginning.

[12:44:55:00]
You know everybody you know it's obvious.

[12:44:57:07]
It's online and it's going to attract you and you're going to be interested because Elvis was amazing and an incredible performer.

[12:45:05:16]
So everybody wants to see that but that's not what makes people come back.

[12:45:11:01]
That's not what makes you come back Sunday after Sunday.

[12:45:14:10]
It's the way he preaches.

[12:45:15:14]
It's how he preaches to your heart.

[12:45:17:10]
And I swear everybody that walks through those doors get a message from Him when you come to church on Sundays.

[12:45:24:03]
It's unreal.

[12:45:25:14]
Tell me about that map thing that you guys do at the top of the church.

[12:45:29:12]
The what?

[12:45:30:09]
The map.

[12:45:31:05]
Oh of all the states.

[12:45:33:01]
We'd been there I believe I was like a record of 26 states at one time.

[12:45:37:08]
So what do they do?

[12:45:40:06]
So people watching this understand what happens at the top of the church.

[12:45:44:03]
Yeah when you come they ask if you're a first time member raise your hands and they ask you where you're from and then they highlight that state on the big screen.

[12:45:53:23]
So eventually you get to see all these states all fill in and it's pretty amazing and there's other countries too as well.

[12:46:02:06]
So on any given Sunday how many new people do you tend to have?

[12:46:06:14]
I've never seen it less than 10 states.

[12:46:10:21]
Correct.

[12:46:11:21]
Yeah 10 states is like the minimum I've ever seen and a lot of times there's you know 3 or four couples that are from the same state.

[12:46:19:02]
So it's there's a lot of a lot of new people there every week.

[12:46:22:11]
And I'd have to say at least half of the people are first-timers.

[12:46:27:03]
Yeah I do.

[12:46:44:15]
When I was a little girl I was about four years old and I was raised with just my mom.

[12:46:49:19]
I didn't know who my dad was.

[12:46:51:19]
I didn't have a dad in the picture at all.

[12:46:54:00]
My world revolved around my mom until I saw the 68 Comeback special on TV and I knew at that moment in my heart at four years old that Elvis Presley was my dad.

[12:47:07:04]
And a friend of my mom's gave me a guitar that had just the two top bass strings on it.

[12:47:12:19]
I would jump on the copy table and strum that guitar and wiggle my hips and do the lip and you know I just knew I had to be because I could do all of these things and I had high cheekbones like him and at that point his daughter Lisa Marie was probably a year just about a year younger than I was.

[12:47:33:21]
She was blonde too you know she had light colored eyes like I did you know it had to be.

[12:47:40:14]
And so I asked my mom "Why didn't you marry Elvis Presley?"

[12:47:46:03]
And she said "Honey he didn't want to marry me."

[12:47:51:08]
And my heart was broken.

[12:47:53:13]
It was sad that he didn't marry my mom.

[12:47:56:12]
I thought she looked a lot like Priscilla.

[12:47:58:12]
She had the big bouffant hairdo and the eyeliner and it was supposed to have been him.

[12:48:05:18]
And I remember exactly where I was when I was 10 years old when it came across the radio that he had passed.

[12:48:13:13]
And I was at Golden Gardens in Seattle and that's where all of my dreams came to an end.

[12:48:18:14]
I knew that I would never meet my dad.

[12:48:22:05]
So do you believe to this day your dad is possibly over-branded?

[12:48:27:05]
No my dad is Peter.

[12:48:30:08]
And I did finally meet him when I was 15 years old.

[12:48:33:05]
But as a little child it was quite a dream to think that this man that was performing all over the world and doing all of these movies you know I watched everything that I could get my hands on because to me that it just felt like that should be.

[12:48:45:05]
I was in love with him as a child as a father figure.

[12:48:49:05]
And they share the same birthday.

[12:48:51:05]
Yes.

[12:48:52:01]
So whether it matters now or not do you believe that Pastor Bob is real?

[12:48:59:07]
I believe that Pastor Bob is Pastor Bob and he is an amazing man  Amazing.  and an amazing pastor and we're so thankful to have him and Wilina in our lives.

[12:49:11:01]
I mean he has just he has brought Jesus into our lives on a daily basis.

[12:49:16:14]
I mean we have so much more love and commitment not that we didn't before.

[12:49:20:18]
God has blessed us truly.

[12:49:22:00]
It brings you closer in your relationship and your journey in life.

[12:49:26:08]
Now you're close to the question I answered. (laughing)  That's the answer. (laughing)  I'm pretty good at that though huh?

[12:49:43:22]
(laughing) I think you guys have a beautiful job.

[12:49:56:05]
Thank you.

[12:49:57:05]
Thank you for doing this today.

[12:49:58:05]
And your answers are very in line with everyone else's.

[12:50:03:05]
Truly it's the love for this man.

[12:50:06:00]
Absolutely.

[12:50:07:00]
I believe God is pushing everybody.

[12:50:09:06]
You know don't watch it online.

[12:50:11:13]
Well watch it online but now go experience it for yourself because that's where you feel the Holy Spirit like working.

[12:50:17:20]
It's amazing.

[12:50:18:16]
It's changed our life.

[12:50:21:06]
I mean seriously every week it's like you know you just I can't I'm yearning for that word you know?

[12:50:29:07]
It's something that's been bothering me all week long.

[12:50:33:03]
And I'll go to church on Sunday and I'm like (scoffs)  Yeah.

[12:50:37:08]
That's why I'm here.

[12:50:37:11]
'Cause God has brought you there to hear this you know?

[12:50:41:21]
So.

[12:50:42:17]
You know when we were on God's path and we were you know going across the United States because that's really what it was.

[12:50:47:03]
We just set out and we didn't know where we were going next.

[12:50:49:21]
And man it just we were here.

[12:50:54:06]
We looked for some property in Arkansas couldn't find any.

[12:50:57:05]
We traveled the southeast.

[12:50:59:03]
We came back and the minute we got over the border we were like we're home.

[12:51:03:21]
This is it.

[12:51:04:14]
And we found property that first week.

[12:51:06:21]
And I had been looking online for a long time every day you know six hours a day.

[12:51:11:09]
I was online looking for property in every state that we were.

[12:51:15:11]
We got exhausted.

[12:51:16:08]
It's like all right let's just go for a vacation.

[12:51:19:03]
We went for a little vacation come back up into Arkansas and we were both were driving.

[12:51:23:14]
We're like "Do you feel like you're coming home?"

[12:51:26:09]
And we've had that same feeling.

[12:51:28:12]
It was the craziest thing.

[12:51:30:06]
And we're like "I feel good here."

[12:51:32:08]
So that's kind of how we knew Arkansas was it.

[12:51:35:05]
And then within a week we found the property.

[12:51:37:10]
And it was for sale for over a year and a half But nobody only one guy came to look at it because some guy in the neighbor was knocking down the signs all the time.

[12:51:48:19]
Yeah he wanted to buy the property but he wanted the price to come down.

[12:51:53:03]
Yeah.

[12:51:53:23]
Is that your neighbor now?

[12:51:55:12]
Yeah.

[12:51:56:08]
Yeah he's a cool guy.

[12:51:57:04]
Yeah really. (laughing) When he found out that somebody was on the property he come flying over like "Who are you guys?"

[12:52:04:19]
I'm like "Hi I'm Brian I'm the new owner." (laughing) Yeah.

[12:52:12:14]
Can I ask this?

[12:52:13:02]
Is there any fear that as more people are exposed to Pastor Bob's ministry is there a fear from congregants that church is going to grow too big?

[12:52:20:09]
Yeah.

[12:52:22:21]
Yeah.

[12:52:23:09]
I think everybody kind of feels it on the inside.

[12:52:25:13]
Worried of losing that community you have?

[12:52:27:13]
Yeah.

[12:52:28:01]
Well not so much the community.

[12:52:29:23]
It's just I don't want the word to be taken away from Jesus.

[12:52:35:04]
