[12:59:42:15]

Yeah.

[12:59:45:03]

[12:59:50:03]
Actually I didn't do electrical plumbing.

[12:59:53:03]
I didn't do the brick.

[12:59:54:02]
I didn't do sheetrock.

[12:59:55:02]
Other than that I did it all.

[12:59:56:02]
Wow.

[12:59:58:02]

[13:00:03:02]
Next week just one?

[13:00:04:02]
Yep.

[13:00:05:02]
Alright so what's the plan?

[13:00:06:02]
Well I think we're gonna start filming over here in the kitchen where he's got uh some memorabilia pulled out You know who he's talked to jack the fair guy That's funny yes you know why we follow him don't you or me I can't speak trisha does  I'm sorry. .

[13:00:39:16]
Why is she so interview.

[13:00:47:17]
I appreciate you being here.

[13:00:50:01]
Is George magazine the same as the other one?

[13:00:53:14]
Helping freezer talk to the team who you should be. nothing to do with the magazine at all.

[13:01:24:08]
He's called the editor and all that stuff he has zero to do with it.

[13:01:28:07]
Zero.

[13:01:29:22]
It's all really weird you know.

[13:01:33:07]
It's all really weird and then the guy that actually there's a guy named Dave Blase which that's not his real name has like 54 criminal indictments against him and all kind of weird stuff.

[13:01:46:01]
It's a weird weird thing.

[13:01:50:13]
I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a quick survey.

[13:01:56:00]
How many indictments the guy that runs the George magazine Dave Blase JT and DJ. should be so  that I'm  I mean I think that's the way it was the phone call I just got off of like all right I'm going to a pitch meeting on the kids stock.

[13:02:41:08]
What's it about?

[13:02:42:01]
Here's what it's about.

[13:02:42:18]
OK that's good.

[13:02:43:10]
We use that.

[13:02:47:10]
Docs are tough.

[13:02:48:10]
You got to find it out.

[13:02:49:10]
But they also take a lot of interesting turns and twists and so they're a puzzle that we can put together in many different ways.

[13:02:55:21]
Well do you want to go over?

[13:02:57:12]
I mean I mean are you just going to ask questions or do you?

[13:03:00:13]
Do you wanna I mean where will we talk about the reasons he would have faked his death?

[13:03:06:14]
I mean where will you just--  I think that's probably more maybe when we get to the office or maybe we why don't we do we're gonna go different order.

[13:03:15:09]
Why don't we start in the kitchen with some of the stuff you pulled.

[13:03:18:17]
Why don't we go up to the man cave well in my own building film up there for a bit.

[13:03:24:15]
And then why don't we head to the office?

[13:03:26:17]
And the office will do a little bit more of the sort of walk and talk stuff And then maybe we'll do a sit down proper just sort of we'll light you and do a nice interview and that sort of nice backdrop.

[13:03:36:11]
Okay.

[13:03:37:13]
Okay.

[13:03:38:04]
And we're going nice and slow. (laughs) There's plenty of time.

[13:03:43:21]
And then you can be talking to Brian you can be talking to me.

[13:03:46:16]
Our voices won't be on camera too much unless necessary.

[13:03:51:10]
So for the most part it'll just be you sort of talking to the audience but you can be looking at me rather than in the lens.

[13:03:56:21]
Right.

[13:03:57:17]
I'm not sure what I'm talking about. that's a good thing.

[13:04:07:14]
So I mean I'm not sure if I can say that again or I miss focus or tilt back.

[13:04:15:14]
You know so let's kind of walk around.

[13:04:17:14]
Well I mean are you all able to use any we use any outside footage like bill Bixby's interviews or anything?

[13:04:23:14]
Yeah.

[13:04:24:14]
So it will be licensing.

[13:04:25:14]
OK OK because he has some really good stuff on there as far as some of the people that students.

[13:04:50:01]
I'm going to go to the room and I'm not sure what happened.

[13:05:03:20]
I'm going to go ahead and get a I was telling them one time we were doing one and we had a whole bunch of people in the house and they done all this work and nine eleven happened.

[13:05:24:23]
We stood there with me in that group and watched.

[13:05:28:06]
Yeah.

[13:05:29:01]
And so they put it off to next week.

[13:05:30:18]
They left stuff in my garage some of it you know and yeah took some of it with them because they had to have it.

[13:05:36:17]
But that was weird.

[13:05:40:03]
All right Steve want to show me what we got over here?

[13:05:43:15]
Yeah.

[13:05:44:13]
Let's see.

[13:05:52:03]
These are the.

[13:06:02:22]
Files from RCA and this this letter here which we'll talk about in a minute is from Janelle McComb which was which was Elvis's mother's best friend and it's got some really interesting information in there and throughout this these these books there is a there's proofs as far as the the actual 45s there's also studio logs who played who played in the in the studio who did the piano who arranged it it's just very interesting stuff through there and I guess we'll talk more about that here in just a minute and then I was able to I was able to to get King Rhee which was Elvis's karate instructor I've got a lot of his stuff and like this is a very interesting thing here Elvis actually designed this okay and then he and King actually put it together and finished it and it even has the date on it.

[13:07:12:19]
It's pretty interesting.

[13:07:15:02]
So what's that document that's-- Well it's actually this patch.

[13:07:19:03]
This patch here and that's what-- and on top of that there's three-- there's three of these made.

[13:07:25:04]
It was after Elvis had died that matches the patch. match.

[13:07:37:02]
Okay.

[13:07:37:02]
And that's one of the three.

[13:07:37:02]
And now in this letter here okay the stuff about Elvis faking his death and everything I guess it will be right here.

[13:08:16:01]
Actually let me back up on that.

[13:08:18:01]
Okay in this letter here a lady named Janelle McComb from RCA sent Janelle McComb a letter.

[13:08:26:13]
Okay and that's this is the letter okay and then she called Janelle on the phone and talked to her the same day okay and what the letter was about was why would there be two A's on Elvis' grave okay and so she was really inquisitive about that.

[13:08:47:16]
And so when you look at this letter from Janelle McComb take it out because this is the original letter here.

[13:08:55:03]
Okay.

[13:08:56:03]
Should have done this.

[13:08:57:03]
I didn't realize we'd be doing it this way.

[13:09:04:04]
But the original letter okay goes through and she's explaining to people about the two A's.

[13:09:13:06]
At this point here she says that most people realize that it has two A's on the grave but Elvis spelled it I believe with one A until the day he died.

[13:09:25:06]
And that's Elvis's mother's best friend.

[13:09:28:01]
As a matter of fact Janelle McComb had all of Elvis's stuff.

[13:09:33:05]
I had all the jumpsuits had all the...

[13:09:35:05]
Everything that you see pretty much at Graceland was actually in Tupelo that she had.

[13:09:40:05]
There was a museum in Tupelo.

[13:09:42:05]
And very interesting.

[13:09:43:23]
Also in this letter here there's also if you go to any of Elvis's properties or Elvis's property Elvis's properties Tupelo Birthplace Graceland there's chapels everywhere.

[13:09:57:20]
And so in this letter here Janelle is talking about her and Elvis walking through the meditation garden and she asked him what would he like to have done to make something special happen there. in Tupelo and he thought for a minute and he talks about it in this letter and said why don't we do a chapel and so that that's also in here which if anybody ever wonders where it came from that's where the idea came from and then it was pretty funny because when Janelle sent the letter to Lauren Laurie Deary okay when she sent it she messed up and also folded up the list of people's names that that paid for the stained glass windows I thought that was funny.

[13:10:40:10]
Pretty interesting.

[13:10:41:20]
And then when you go back to the two A's what they did was they did a first birth certificate okay was done on 10th of January.

[13:10:55:02]
And it had two A's because the biblical spelling of Aaron is A-R-O-N.

[13:11:00:19]
Alright?

[13:11:01:10]
And two days later on the 12th it was changed to one A. And the reason it had to be one A was because the middle name with Jesse the brother G-A-R-O-N and so that's why they wanted to spell it so Elvis would be carrying his brother's name with him throughout the thing.

[13:11:18:06]
Now if you go through all of the records everything this is the middle school record you can already see that but that's Aaron.

[13:11:25:14]
1A high school diploma 1A high school annual 1A and you can just go through just countless Library card 1a you go through this right here is a medical examiner report.

[13:11:40:15]
This is also interesting Talk about it in just a minute but This right here has been proven to be Elvis's handwriting And also the the words here as far as entertainer This has actually been proven by handwriting experts and that's This right here is actually the when Elvis supposedly died on August 16th.

[13:12:01:02]
Okay this right here was the report It was done the medical report and this is his handwriting right here.

[13:12:07:20]
And I would imagine he expected them to copy it over and evidently they got lazy and didn't do that.

[13:12:13:19]
Okay but then again I mean like I said there's just so much proof Aaron Aaron everything is 8 1A all the way through even the marriage certificate okay?

[13:12:23:20]
There's a better copy here that I think they use for promotional stuff with a picture on it.

[13:12:28:20]
But everything has 1A Social Security card has 1A. as 1A. His induction papers into the military all the stuff that was done you know he was big time he loved law enforcement okay which we'll talk about that in a few minutes.

[13:12:48:11]
But the RCA stuff and back to the RCA letter so what happened is Joan Deary she decided that they were just they would keep it 1A. And so RCA never changed to 2A's.

[13:13:04:18]
And the correspondence is in here that was actually in the RCA files talking about that.

[13:13:10:01]
And so they left it at 1A throughout the whole time.

[13:13:13:09]
And you know this is what was buried in '77.

[13:13:18:18]
And that's what it looked like in '77.

[13:13:22:00]
And this picture here came from the last concert. was just laid in there.

[13:13:25:00]
So do you think that's fake pictures at your time?

[13:13:28:15]
Well no what happened was there was and we can go into all that.

[13:13:33:16]
What happened was there was a wax figure and from what we were told it actually come from Atlanta.

[13:13:40:18]
There was a museum in Atlanta that had closed up and that's what they decided to use.

[13:13:47:01]
I can explain it in detail all the way through the whole process but when I seen this when when I was a kid I say kid I mean I was 21 22 when I seen this I knew that Elvis was still alive.

[13:14:00:23]
I just knew it because there was no way in the world you could tell me that's Elvis.

[13:14:04:13]
All right now I'm out.

[13:14:10:03]
The RCA letter you're saying that was them determining how they wanted to promote him as a performer?

[13:14:17:12]
Right.

[13:14:18:08]
And if they were gonna change the spelling to what?

[13:14:20:01]
Well in all of Elvis's records like I can't find mine it's somewhere around here but if you look at the silver anniversary 25th year of Elvis you know after he was dead and things you know it talks about in fact I've got some of the print in here where it talks about Aaron.

[13:14:39:00]
See this is some of the print that's actually on the books.

[13:14:41:08]
And this is the RCA files.

[13:14:43:07]
Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron just all the way through the whole thing.

[13:14:47:00]
And actually even on the actual album that was sold it has eight different albums in it.

[13:14:52:19]
And it's a silver thing.

[13:14:54:02]
And across the thing diagonally is ARON Elvis Aaron Presley.

[13:14:59:08]
But I've got just so much stuff.

[13:15:05:05]
Steve what's the reason that the tombstone would have two A's then?

[13:15:10:12]
Well we don't nobody knows that but if you look at the stuff that actually happened or let me find my stuff here even the funeral announcement okay Vernon Presley supposedly put the two A's on the grave.

[13:15:37:10]
But the funeral announcement has one A. The sympathy that he sent out has one A. And then the sign that was in front of Graceland had one A. And they changed it in the 90s to two A's.

[13:15:54:21]
But that was not done until the 90s.

[13:15:58:17]
And they say that Ellis's name was sold.

[13:16:01:15]
So we sort of think maybe that they sold the 2A name and not the And not the 1A. We know nobody really knows and we won't know till it all eventually comes out one day But he was definitely a RON Yeah let me get you a good shot of that Vernon sent us out Spell spell two ways on the grave  So who would have decided how to spell it on the grave?

[13:16:34:14]
He would have because he was the heir other than Lisa Marie being the child.

[13:16:40:15]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:16:43:22]
And even the postmortem report.

[13:16:46:00]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:16:48:19]
As one I mean everything's one.

[13:16:50:11]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:16:52:02]
So we don't.

[13:16:52:18]
Is there anywhere else where there is two?

[13:16:54:22]
Well I've seen on one of the things that somebody put out of Priscilla of the divorce that had two A's on it but that was probably fake.

[13:17:03:10]
That's just that wouldn't have made sense because I mean everything everything says one A. I mean I pulled up probably 50 different official documents from his military records even his if I can find it in here even his dental records in the military.

[13:17:24:05]
Even his dental records in the military have one A. everything is 1A. But to me Janelle McCombs letter that's pretty much what I mean nobody's ever seen that before.

[13:17:38:19]
That's the first time it's ever been ever been seen.

[13:17:43:02]
Yep that was Janelle McCombs and she the lady from RCA like I said she had all of Elvis's stuff Janelle McCombs did and what happened was the lady from RCA had to find out about the two A's because they're fixing to do that big 25th anniversary album and so they sent her the letter but the letter that she sent and Janelle McComb's response were the same day so that means that she probably called Miss McComb and that's what that's what happened but Janelle McComb was a wonderful lady I had a chance to meet her and she was very sweet and she loved Elvis and she really loved Elvis just like everybody did.

[13:18:26:17]
Just like everybody.

[13:18:28:17]
So the 2A's now they've changed the plaque you said or they changed the--  Yep.

[13:18:32:23]
And the gravestone.

[13:18:33:19]
Right.

[13:18:34:15]
That's pretty much the only--  Well in Graceland all that area and also in Tupelo now is 2A's okay?

[13:18:42:13]
And like the place that his mother bought the first guitar for $10 it's a hardware store in Tupelo.

[13:18:50:11]
And they can't even say the word Elvis in there anymore.

[13:18:53:22]
And I'll show you a ruler if you like see it downstairs that actually says this is where Elvis This is where his mother bought his first guitar or something like that And so they they give those rulers away but it's 1a Well like I said they probably sold it sold the name and maybe There were the real name wasn't gonna be sold.

[13:19:16:11]
I know nobody really knows everything speculation but I do know that it was 1a and it wasn't officially changed anywhere except for Memphis and Graceland and Tupelo No well what they say is that Elvis later on in his life had decided that he really truly would like it to spell like it is in the Bible and so he changed it but there's no record of that other than just You know hearsay and like I said Janelle McComb she knew Elvis from when he was almost born He was she was a little bitty boy when she met him and and there's no way in the world She would have she would have done anything Or said anything wrong in there about that days.

[13:20:02:08]
So that's that's a pretty definite thing there Probably because He he Ellis really struggled with the fact that his younger brother died and he he felt very guilty about the fact that you know he had such Good things happening in his life and his brother died and so by having a RON is his middle name you know he sort of carried his brother along with him and and I think that he even used After 77 I think he even used Jesse as his name Some of the time he used John Burroughs but I think he used Jesse a pretty good bit too throughout the years Well yeah yeah I mean Well that's probably the biggest thing there that him you know it would actually be it would actually be fraudulent for for his name to be On there like he's in that grave you know just like there's you know a life insurance policy.

[13:21:18:12]
It wouldn't catch then after he died There's a lot of things in that direction.

[13:21:22:15]
So you're exactly right there Well are you gonna get into the the the reasons why he would have Okay there was a lot that that went on with with Elvis he There's basically three reasons why and if you listen to people talk a lot of people You know talked about him being a drug addict and doing all this stuff He did take medicine to go in his prescription medicine to go to sleep and to get up but past that Elvis despised illegal drugs and so he went to Nixon a President Nixon and he wrote he wrote a letter which you can find everybody can find it online Talking about what his fear of what's happening in the country as far as what the drug culture and everything's doing to America and he asked for a meeting with with Nixon.

[13:22:25:13]
Okay and so Here again a lot of people say that you know that it didn't happen Well it did because this picture right here okay if you look at the National Archives the most requested thing from the National Archives is this picture.

[13:22:45:17]
More so than the Constitution Bill of Rights that's the most sought after thing that's in the National Archives okay.

[13:22:54:09]
And he really and truly became a DEA agent.

[13:22:58:17]
He was an official agent.

[13:23:00:07]
And from speculation on the dates but sometime after the meeting in December of '70 he had undercover agents that would be in his group when he would do concerts.

[13:23:13:22]
And those agents when they would do the concerts and be preparing things they would arrange drug buys.

[13:23:20:14]
And when they did the drug buys and all the illegal stuff going on Elvis would leave town after the concert and then these undercover guys would go and they'd busted the drug people and then they wound up actually taking down a pretty good sized drug kingpins here and there.

[13:23:38:09]
And so it took a while I guess they were slow but it took a while and they finally realized every time Elvis come to town they got busted.

[13:23:49:03]
And so they really and truly they put a hit out on Elvis okay?

[13:23:55:03]
That was the first thing.

[13:23:56:20]
And then in 1976 there was a group called the fraternity.

[13:24:04:03]
And they were some underlings of a large mafia family.

[13:24:07:11]
And they had a business where they would go around and people that had multiple airplanes they would steal the airplane an airplane.

[13:24:16:02]
And so in '76 they reached out to Vernon Presley about buying one of Elvis's airplanes.

[13:24:20:21]
Well then Vernon told Elvis. and Elvis told his buddies at the FBI and DEA and so they created a sting.

[13:24:29:14]
And they wound up actually writing a bonus check these guys did and that gave the government a way to get 'em.

[13:24:39:17]
And so in online you can actually Google Elvis FBI files and there's still about 1200 pages there okay?

[13:24:51:14]
There was a total of about 1400 and there's about 76 pages that are redacted still actually top secret.

[13:24:57:18]
You can't see But what happened was this thing went through the process and then on August 15th 1977 Now remember the date August 15th 1977 Elvis testified at the Memphis Grand Jury against These guys okay Now the the two of the guys two of the main guys that did the plane stealing They wound up putting this these two guys on witness protection to testify against the big big drug lord Okay and so what happened there is?

[13:25:29:05]
By them putting those two guys then you know I'm sure Elvis was also put in in this insecurity system because You know if I put those two crooks in you know good Well they would have to protect Elvis because they put a hit out on Elvis and he was very tear He was worried about his mother and his dad.

[13:25:48:19]
He really didn't care about himself but he was worried about his mother and his dad Okay and so that's the second reason that he would have faked his death And then the third reason is he truly hated his life He was I mean you think about this y'all been around stuff your entire lives as far as music and you'd have never heard any of the top concerts musicians you never heard any of them sing how great their art or other gospel songs in concerts.

[13:26:18:15]
It just didn't happen.

[13:26:20:05]
He would do two shows a day in Las Vegas and would sing gospel music all night long.

[13:26:27:09]
I mean it just so when I look at Elvis and when I did all my research and when I was a child he's always been basically a preacher.

[13:26:38:17]
He's always been you know he's always been a good man.

[13:26:42:09]
And the image they even talked about that in a few videos about the image and it truly was an image.

[13:26:48:07]
It was really it was like I had a chance to meet Don Knott.

[13:26:51:23]
And Don Knott and Barney Fife were two separate things.

[13:26:56:17]
And Elvis and you know and I don't know what to say on that one but we'll work on it I guess.

[13:27:06:11]
But it's definitely two different people.

[13:27:09:05]
But he's always been who he was.

[13:27:11:11]
Another thing also about the reason he hated his life was Colonel Parker really truly took advantage of Elvis.

[13:27:19:19]
And he had the last-- I don't know what the number is-- the last number of concerts he did in Las Vegas he did for free.

[13:27:28:18]
Because Colonel Parker had such a gambling debt built up they said he would lose over a million dollars a day.

[13:27:34:10]
So Elvis did those for free and truthfully Colonel Parker controlled him.

[13:27:39:08]
And so when you start adding all that stuff up plus the hits it's pretty easy for him to decide what to do.

[13:27:47:00]
And I don't think there were a lot of people in the planning of it but the wax figure was used.

[13:27:51:04]
And it was history after that.

[13:27:57:09]
Speaking of Colonel Parker for a second I heard things like He famously told him he was worth more to him dead than alive and Colonel Parker created his own persona himself so he would know how to can you talk about that?

[13:28:12:20]
Well he did.

[13:28:13:13]
And if you listen to the last concert to the words they say on the screen when they talk about over the loudspeaker that gets your merchandise now it's once it's gone it's gone.

[13:28:25:09]
I mean there's just a lot of things that happen there.

[13:28:27:02]
But Colonel Parker he knew that he would make more money with Elvis being dead.

[13:28:34:00]
There's not I haven't found a lot of documentation but I just you know I just know that.

[13:28:39:05]
Colonel Parker created his own persona right?

[13:28:42:01]
Oh yeah yeah.

[13:28:42:21]
He took all the credit for it.

[13:28:45:04]
And he honestly felt like he deserved all the money that he made which was half of what Elvis made.

[13:28:52:03]
No I mean Colonel Parker invented like who he was as a person as well.

[13:28:55:10]
Right right.

[13:28:56:06]
So he would be he'd probably be a good cohort to help pick your death.

[13:29:00:04]
Oh yeah yeah.

[13:29:01:00]
He would have been right in and that would have been a whole lot easier because really and truly his job got easier after that.

[13:29:08:01]
He just raked in the money and a lot of money came in after Elvis supposedly died.

[13:29:12:03]
Steve can you go back to talking about Elvis testifying on August 15th to the Memphis Grand Jury?

[13:29:21:02]
Yeah.

[13:29:22:02]
What's the importance of that I think?

[13:29:23:02]
Well on August 15th '77 when he testified this is actually one of the files that you can download from the internet.

[13:29:30:16]
When he testified on the 15th then the next day at 2.46 p.m he died.

[13:29:37:07]
So he went to the dentist that night.

[13:29:40:20]
He had an emergency appointment late at night to go to the dentist.

[13:29:44:05]
And then he played racquetball for several hours after that.

[13:29:46:23]
And then he died at 2.46 p.m.

[13:29:50:14]
And if you look back earlier than that in the month of July there was two life insurance policies cashed in.

[13:29:59:08]
There was a million dollars taken from his secret personal checking account.

[13:30:03:06]
They were just all kind of things that lined up for that.

[13:30:05:19]
And they claimed that he had a root canal.

[13:30:10:00]
And I don't know about you guys but if you have a root canal how in the world are you gonna play racquetball for hours?

[13:30:15:14]
That usually knocks somebody out but that's their but we think that it was probably to take the gap because I mean to put see Elvis had a gap when he was young in his teeth okay?

[13:30:26:14]
And you can see pictures which I've got one here somewhere. and we think that he put caps on it to remove the gap and we think they probably took the caps off so they'd have a gap because he was trying to figure out ways that he would be recognized uh... whose account is it that says that he went to the dentist and then played racquetball oh it's it's Graceland's official report yeah if you do the tour they'll tell you that he he went to the dentist and and that was really a a strange thing too that he went to the dentist like that.

[13:30:59:03]
How is Graceland when it comes to these sort of questions and information flow?

[13:31:03:20]
Well Graceland there's really and truly they've got a script and that's what they go by.

[13:31:11:00]
And plus most of the young people at Graceland that work there they know nothing really and truly about about Elvis.

[13:31:17:07]
You know they've never they don't know much about him.

[13:31:23:10]
Steve walk through that timeline of when he passed to the actual ceremony happening.

[13:31:32:01]
I've got some notes.

[13:31:35:02]
Is it OK if I look at some notes so that I don't forget anything on this thing?

[13:31:38:18]
OK. OK he was pronounced dead at 2:56 PM.

[13:31:46:15]
And by 1130 the next morning August 17 the body was put on display.

[13:31:51:21]
And the body was put on display because the mafia had to see a body.

[13:31:56:10]
And that's why they had to do the wax figure.

[13:31:58:04]
The National Enquirer paid I forget which cousin it was but paid one of Elvis' cousins to take that one picture.

[13:32:06:01]
Paid him $18000 of the picture for the get that picture.

[13:32:09:08]
Elvis supposedly weighed about 242 pounds that day.

[13:32:15:08]
And if you look and I don't have it with me but If you look at the actual last report it showed he weighed 170 or 80.

[13:32:22:02]
Okay so that was a mess there.

[13:32:24:16]
Now from when he died at 2.46 p.m which by the way they took him also to the hospital that was further away and also they had claimed that they tried to revive him in the bathroom and then they also have said that it was rigor mortis that already set in so there's a lot of missteps there.

[13:32:45:11]
But from 2 4 to 6 p.m. until 1130 the next day they did a county autopsy.

[13:32:52:03]
They embalmed the body.

[13:32:53:19]
And in my opinion if somebody is that famous they will probably be looking into it for foul play or something.

[13:33:01:18]
But that happened.

[13:33:03:13]
They also ordered 16 white Cadillac limousines.

[13:33:08:02]
They ordered a custom white hearse.

[13:33:10:14]
They designed a casket.

[13:33:13:07]
And the casket weighed approximately 900 pounds.

[13:33:16:21]
And the way you can tell that is how many people that it took to actually carry the casket.

[13:33:21:21]
It took probably 15 18 people.

[13:33:24:03]
And another real important part is Elvis was a veteran.

[13:33:28:23]
Elvis loved America.

[13:33:30:16]
And his casket if he had of died would have had an American flag on it.

[13:33:35:18]
But Elvis wouldn't do that.

[13:33:37:00]
You know he loves soldiers he loves police and he would not do that.

[13:33:40:21]
And so what they did is they actually sewed 500 roses into a blanket and that's what they covered the casket with.

[13:33:49:09]
All right.

[13:33:50:15]
Security and police was ordered for all this and it takes a while to set up something this big.

[13:33:56:11]
Upcoming tour was canceled.

[13:33:58:09]
Elvis didn't order any jump seats for the next tour.

[13:34:01:19]
Vernon Presley his father made calls to the club presidents and asked them not to come and also to ask their members not to come.

[13:34:10:04]
Clothing was chosen songs were chosen ministers contacted and the possession was planned.

[13:34:19:13]
And then only a few we from what we've dug up only a few of the friends and family actually knew about it this whole process going on.

[13:34:30:13]
They had to keep it really tight-lipped.

[13:34:32:12]
That's all within what time frame?

[13:34:34:19]
Within about 20 and a half 21 hours.

[13:34:36:21]
From the time his body was found.

[13:34:39:04]
Yep yep and that's just virtually impossible.

[13:34:42:06]
I've talked to people that own funeral homes and they said there's no way.

[13:34:45:20]
Especially being a county deal and also somebody that big as far as celebrity it's just not possible.

[13:34:52:03]
So the theories of this was a planned event that-  Yeah yeah it was definitely planned.

[13:34:57:03]
It was definitely planned when he testified on the 15th of August they pull the trigger and that was it because the mafia don't play around.

[13:35:05:17]
I'm not sure if I'm going to be you know you come off like you which is important.

[13:35:19:01]
Right?

[13:35:19:21]
You know like and you come off quite knowledgeable.

[13:35:23:04]
Well I didn't know I didn't know if we would go through some of this stuff before we did this.

[13:35:26:12]
I think what we'll probably do I mean some of this stuff we might go over twice if not every time you know.

[13:35:31:07]
So like when we do a proper sit down with you I might ask you for a little bit more detail but seeing this stuff candidly is really interesting.

[13:35:37:05]
'Cause I really I think and this is just my opinion But I think that you know I think you know 50/50.

[13:35:47:09]
I think if you really see things I think that when you leave here you might be 90 or 95 or 99.

[13:35:56:06]
And I think that would probably help you with your movie.

[13:36:00:18]
That's the hope.

[13:36:02:04]
So then may I ask if Elvis were to fake his death what do we think Elvis would have done with himself?

[13:36:09:08]
Well the same thing Priscilla said he'd be singing gospel and preaching.

[13:36:12:20]
That's exactly what Priscilla said.

[13:36:15:17]
Are there any signs of anyone out there singing gospel and preaching?

[13:36:20:04]
Yeah there is.

[13:36:21:12]
Yeah there is.

[13:36:24:05]
Well you wanna maybe point me to someone that we could do some look at some research on?

[13:36:31:04]
Yeah probably look at Bob Joyce.

[13:36:33:03]
Yeah.

[13:36:34:00]
And been in Arkansas.

[13:36:35:08]
Yeah.

[13:36:36:14]
What do we know about Bob Joyce?

[13:36:37:15]
How'd you first come into contact with Bob?

[13:36:39:17]
Well Bob Joyce we were my wife's birthday is in August and so I'm sorry.

[13:36:50:00]
You know what let's go back.

[13:36:51:04]
Yeah.

[13:36:52:00]
Let's talk before we're gonna do this but I don't wanna do this conversation in the kitchen.

[13:36:55:05]
I think this is more of a friendly conversation 'cause he is your friend you know?

[13:36:58:22]
And so why don't we why don't we stay on the Elvis memorabilia before we take the leap to Bob?

[13:37:05:01]
Okay okay.

[13:37:06:04]
So do we wanna go is there anything else?

[13:37:07:21]
Well it's up to you I mean because what I've got You know upstairs I showed you the geese and stuff that are upstairs okay?

[13:37:15:07]
And then certificate I've got stuff that Graceland don't have okay?

[13:37:23:07]
See that certificate there?

[13:37:25:17]
And then there's some cool stuff here somewhere.

[13:37:28:17]
Let me find it. might be right here.

[13:37:43:09]
But we've got some other interesting things that one thing I was able to purchase which is probably any good for your video but I was able to purchase oh there they are I was able to purchase I've got almost all the negatives of Elvis karate stuff now.

[13:38:09:08]
Even the ones that are in Graceland.

[13:38:11:09]
But this right here is pretty interesting.

[13:38:13:13]
This is does the glare mess with it?

[13:38:16:08]
Let me pull it out.

[13:38:17:09]
This here is the contracts that Elvis signed to do karate with Kangri and there's a carbon copy and there's no there's none of this in Graceland.

[13:38:29:18]
This is them and so I would imagine they probably took the top copy and threw it in the car or put it in or pocket or whatever because this is the only thing.

[13:38:38:19]
And there's actually three of them there where he signed his friends of the West and other people.

[13:38:44:05]
Pretty cool.

[13:38:46:08]
It's hard to get stuff like this.

[13:38:51:07]
Why do you collect stuff like this personally?

[13:38:53:07]
Well I don't know I just love collecting and the costumes the jumpsuits and things like that they're already in somebody's collection and they've already went up in value to would be worth anybody trying to purchase them.

[13:39:08:04]
You just be making a bad investment probably.

[13:39:09:13]
So this is about the only thing that somebody can collect that you know really love Elvis.

[13:39:14:14]
Thanks.

[13:39:17:10]
You want to show me the man cave there?

[13:39:21:03]
If you want to.

[13:39:21:17]
Where's the LaVon go?

[13:39:23:17]
This is a mess back there.

[13:39:28:05]
This is a mess back through here so but you're not going to film through the mess.

[13:39:33:03]
That'd be terrible.

[13:39:37:21]
That would be terrible.

[13:39:42:02]
This won't look like this when I get the house done.

[13:39:52:13]
[BLANK_AUDIO] [ Pause ]

[13:40:26:12]
to the right side of the room. cave.

[13:40:57:08]
Things like this is an original which is pretty cool.

[13:41:04:06]
But it's just Elvis stuff in here.

[13:41:07:08]
Here's the two geese that was actually in the pictures downstairs.

[13:41:11:17]
They're still I'm still doing that.

[13:41:13:03]
So.

[13:41:13:08]
Yeah.

[13:41:14:08]
[ Pause ]

[13:41:44:07]
Alright what do we got over here?

[13:41:55:01]
These are the two geese that Wayne Carman his sparring partner wore.

[13:42:00:17]
That's his black belts.

[13:42:01:17]
So those were the Elvis.

[13:42:02:17]
Elvis and you can see where he put on the sleeve TCB on both of them.

[13:42:10:23]
And actually even the back of this one looks good.

[13:42:25:22]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:42:35:22]
Elvis was really big in karate.

[13:42:46:17]
Why is that Ken?

[13:42:50:07]
I don't know maybe to help protect himself from all the crazy fans or what but he was definitely he was an eighth degree black belt.

[13:42:58:00]
Wow.

[13:42:59:03]
He ties into the superhero persona at all maybe?

[13:43:01:21]
Yeah.

[13:43:02:22]
I've got a comic book downstairs that I'll show you and it's Captain Marvel Jr.

[13:43:08:23]
And that was Elvis's hero when he was a kid.

[13:43:11:12]
And that's where the jumpsuit come from.

[13:43:13:21]
That's where the hair that's where the lightning bolt that's where the cape comes from was that comic book.

[13:43:19:01]
And the one I've got downstairs is also a comic book where Captain Marvel Jr. faked his death.

[13:43:25:09]
So everybody kind of thinks that's probably where the idea came from in the first place.

[13:43:29:20]
And plus there's been other famous people in the past you know faked their deaths and things.

[13:43:33:20]
So but they think that the comic book probably was the reason that he did that.

[13:43:41:01]
Tell me a little bit about you.

[13:43:43:00]
Why do you have this impressive room?

[13:43:45:09]
Well my wife says I'm just a king sized kid but I don't know.

[13:43:51:11]
I had a chance like I said to do stuff with Don Knott's and Mayberry people.

[13:43:57:22]
And anything I've ever done I've just always been 1000%.

[13:44:02:21]
So if I do something I'm going to do it all the way.

[13:44:06:08]
And so this is sort of what happened.

[13:44:09:02]
And when people come here they probably just think I'm crazy is probably what they think.

[13:44:15:03]
But I just love collecting.

[13:44:18:09]
I just love doing stuff.

[13:44:20:18]
And it's also a good investment.

[13:44:22:19]
People don't understand that a lot of times.

[13:44:24:22]
If you pick the right thing it could definitely be a great investment.

[13:44:27:18]
Right on.

[13:44:28:15]
Did it collect your own life?

[13:44:33:21]
Well I actually started this here I started in actually I started every bit of this in the 90s.

[13:44:40:17]
[ Silence ] [ Silence ] [PAUSE] [ Pause ]

[13:46:02:15]
It's amazing right?

[13:46:04:03]
Wow.

[13:46:04:23]
It's amazing.

[13:46:06:03]
[ Silence ] [ Pause ]

[13:46:59:02]
I'm not sure.

[13:47:10:16]
What's your most prized possession?

[13:47:11:11]
Well I probably well on the Mayberry side Don's hat badge and then some of the scripts are actually given to me by the cast members and then the Elvis stuff.

[13:47:21:21]
I mean those geese I mean those are those were actually participated with those for four years. the first time I was here.

[13:47:35:18]
I'm and I was able to get a lot of I just had the opportunity to work with Don and you know book signings bodyguard just stuff like that through the years.

[13:47:54:22]
And then also after that it wound up being most of the cast members.

[13:48:01:06]
The only two that I didn't do stuff for was actually Andy and Ron Howard.

[13:48:06:07]
But it wound up being pretty much all of them.

[13:48:10:10]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:48:19:05]
I patterned my life after Elvis.

[13:48:21:03]
I don't drink never have drank in my life never tasted a swallow of any kind.

[13:48:26:08]
And I just always when I was a kid I don't know if we'll talk about that maybe in a little bit.

[13:48:33:06]
But when I was a kid he was my hero and so.

[13:48:38:13]
[INAUDIBLE]  Well when I and [BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:48:46:13]
Y'all can cut some of this you'll cut probably almost all of it anyway.

[13:48:50:23]
Cuz I can't say some of the stuff because it would hurt my folks.

[13:48:53:23]
And so but the point was I would go to the room the living room where Elvis was played all the time at my house.

[13:49:05:16]
My mother loved Elvis.

[13:49:06:16]
And so and then my grandmother had started getting me matchbox cars.

[13:49:11:04]
And so I would go to the room where I could hear Elvis and I could play with my matchbox cars.

[13:49:17:15]
And I just sort of you know just sort of didn't hear anything else.

[13:49:20:23]
And so that that um I don't know happened a long time.

[13:49:26:14]
And then um and then movies I started watching the Elvis movies and I noticed in the movies he was always kind.

[13:49:33:21]
He was always humble.

[13:49:34:19]
He was always not necessarily humble but he was always polite.

[13:49:38:08]
He was always generous.

[13:49:40:20]
And he was really never the bad guy except for maybe one of the Westerns.

[13:49:44:04]
He really wasn't a bad guy then.

[13:49:45:07]
But I don't know I just patterned my life after him watching the movies and stuff.

[13:49:51:08]
And I had Superman and Elvis that was my two heroes.

[13:49:54:14]
And so Elvis when he died in '77 it really tore me up.

[13:49:59:14]
I mean I literally cried a 21 year old guy for three days because I was I was just distraught about it My wife said why are you crying?

[13:50:13:06]
You didn't know him and and I told her I said I said when I was young for some reason I realized he probably Didn't have any friends.

[13:50:22:20]
I realized for somehow the other that he was being used by everybody And so I used to even say to myself when I was a kid That I'd be your friend and stuff like that.

[13:50:34:02]
I mean it was really a really so I didn't know him and You know that's why I knew that Elvis wasn't a bad guy Some of the people talk about it like I said drugs and things like that Everybody that's a bunch of much of nonsense.

[13:50:46:02]
He uh he did he didn't like He didn't like anything recreational like that and so I've always taken up for him and then And then like I said we were in we were in Tepelo and went to the birthplace and and there was and I had actually bought There's a stand-up back there that I had bought an Elvis stand-up and some other things and the older woman and she's older than I Was actually and she said You're a real Elvis fan.

[13:51:16:18]
Aren't you and I said yes ma'am I am and then she asked me she said have you ever heard of Bob Joyce and I said no ma'am And she said well Google him and I said well who is it and she said Google him and so So that's sort of where the the second thing is The second part of the last four and a half years has taken place because and and truthfully Jesus and my family and and and then like I said Elvis was my hero and so In that order basically Superman wasn't real.

[13:51:52:14]
I liked it.

[13:51:53:06]
He was strong and all that kind of stuff but you know Elvis was a real person so I don't know it sort of just changed my life after the lady told me about that.

[13:52:02:03]
Well you know everybody knows well everybody thinks probably most people think that it's only girls you know females that was crazy about Elvis you They would tear his clothes off and do all kind of crazy stuff.

[13:52:25:02]
My mother carried me to a concert when I was 14.

[13:52:27:15]
We was about four rows back.

[13:52:30:06]
And I was so shocked.

[13:52:31:20]
I couldn't hardly watch Elvis for watching the females you know the way they were doing and acting.

[13:52:36:16]
I was just shocked.

[13:52:38:06]
And but truthfully there are probably millions of males that just really and truly I mean Elvis I mean He started off as a nobody driving a truck electrician.

[13:52:53:04]
You know he placed third in talent contests music contests I mean he was just a regular person.

[13:53:00:20]
And then he became you know the most famous person and Jesus is the most famous name of course and I'm not saying anything I'm not comparing anything to Jesus.

[13:53:11:20]
But Jesus was the most famous person on earth.

[13:53:14:12]
And then Elvis Elvis as far as a human being there's nobody that can rival him.

[13:53:22:20]
And so the males they seen where he started and he had everything that a boy would dream of from toys to money to fame to fortune to looks talent females he had everything.

[13:53:38:05]
And so you would literally be surprised I'm not saying that I'm not a I'm not saying that I'm not I'm you know I think that's a very you know that's cool.

[13:53:57:18]
So Max Max boxes as a kid uh matchbox with a kid.

[13:54:05:05]
Yeah.

[13:54:06:08]
Yeah.

[13:54:07:13]
I don't think that's an uncommon story.

[13:54:13:04]
I think you framed it well.

[13:54:17:09]
But.

[13:54:18:04]
Escaping from the noise was a-  Yeah yeah.

[13:54:23:04]
Pleasant for you.

[13:54:24:22]
That's what I did.

[13:54:25:23]
And when I heard he died it was terrible.

[13:54:35:19]
I mean it was-  Where were you?

[13:54:38:02]
I was actually I just got home.

[13:54:39:05]
I had four jobs back then.

[13:54:40:18]
And I just had got home and well I was distraught.

[13:54:44:22]
It was terrible.

[13:54:45:14]
It was terrible.

[13:54:48:11]
But when I seen the picture of the coffin then I felt better because I felt like he was still with us and then I used to pray that he was having a good life and having fun and living and not being taken advantage of.

[13:55:02:09]
I used to pray that stuff a lot.

[13:55:04:13]
And then throughout the years I would do research and build Bixby's special.

[13:55:11:01]
I mean it was all kind of stuff that led in that direction.

[13:55:15:03]
And if you think about it I mean There's been rumors ever since '77 of people seeing him and like I said the TV specials and things like that.

[13:55:24:14]
To me that just says it all.

[13:55:28:17]
I think it was maybe 1999 or somewhere around there that Priscilla did a movie called "Finding Graceland."

[13:55:37:05]
She was executive producer and it was about Elvis coming home and why would she do that?

[13:55:42:21]
There's just so much that says that Elvis is not dead and didn't die.

[13:55:50:19]
And for you it was the it was honestly the moment you saw the picture of the casket?

[13:55:55:04]
Oh yeah that was pretty much everybody that really loved Elvis.

[13:55:58:01]
They seen that picture.

[13:55:59:11]
And what that picture was I matched it up years ago and it was about a 20 year old Elvis and he was laying on a sofa in Germany is really and truly where that picture was probably of that wax figure was taken from was from that picture. because the the the the coffin pitcher he had a pug nose and I'm not even sure Elvis had a pug nose really when he was 20 years old but it was definitely the nose was different the eyebrows everything was totally different.

[13:56:26:04]
So I knew it wasn't Elvis.

[13:56:28:01]
And that gave me a great deal of satisfaction.

[13:56:31:04]
And in fact that that made it easier to you know even though I realized I'd never see him again or hear him again as far as anything new then at least I had the hope that he was living a life and enjoying life and because he couldn't go to football games he couldn't go anywhere.

[13:56:47:09]
When did you see that picture?

[13:56:50:00]
It was pretty much when it came out because all my friends they all in fact I had a guy that I haven't seen in probably 40 years found me on Facebook and he said in messaging with me he said do you still listen to Elvis all the time?

[13:57:10:10]
And I said "Yeah I do."

[13:57:11:22]
And he said "You still listen to him over and over and over?"

[13:57:13:23]
I said "Yes I do."

[13:57:15:10]
And I just thought that was really strange that somebody would remember that from that long ago.

[13:57:19:16]
And maybe in 50 years ago maybe it was a long time ago that he remembered that.

[13:57:23:20]
But I could sing all of Elvis's songs you know lip sync 'em and you'd think it was him.

[13:57:29:12]
But of course I don't sing but you know it's just awesome.

[13:57:33:22]
And I really and truly wished the world and everybody that's taught bad about him just understood that they're really interested in what they're talking about.

[13:57:44:17]
'Cause I know that when Red West and Sonny West and Dave Hibbler they wrote the book that broke Elvis's heart said all this bunch of stuff in it.

[13:57:54:17]
Well I know the guy I know a guy that was friends with Red West okay?

[13:57:59:20]
And he had a conversation with Red West about the book. and Red West told him that he was so sorry that he did it.

[13:58:10:19]
He said once it was finished he said he wished he'd never done it.

[13:58:13:19]
He said he was just completely remorseful.

[13:58:17:02]
And I would really I think I'm gonna get this friend of mine to actually maybe even write down the conversation and give it to me because that's pretty interesting pretty awesome.

[13:58:29:19]
And I think it would make Elvis feel better if he knew that there was a lot of sorrow and they wished they hadn't done what they did.

[13:58:37:02]
Because like I said it broke Elvis's heart when they did that so.

[13:58:40:00]
Why'd they do it?

[13:58:41:09]
Well because when things and of course everything's speculation about when and how and all that.

[13:58:48:21]
But the thing about it is when it was put together that or the idea was put together that he's gonna have to leave because of the hits that were put out on him they started cutting back and Elvis had actually told his dad we're gonna have to get rid of some people and it was supposed to be temporary and so Vernon let Red West and those guys go.

[13:59:13:15]
And then Elvis had told his dad but hire them back.

[13:59:17:00]
And then you know and so you know and but he never hired them back.

[13:59:21:07]
And so you know it just it just created a whole I don't know they just they just I guess they were gonna make money off of it.

[13:59:30:07]
You know I don't know but but you know nobody's perfect.

[13:59:33:10]
Of course Elvis by no means was perfect.

[13:59:35:19]
And I've even thought throughout my life how I might have handled being Elvis or how other people that I know would handle being Elvis.

[13:59:46:04]
I think you've done pretty doggone good for everything you had going on.

[13:59:49:15]
'Cause we're only human.

[13:59:50:17]
And it'd be an amazing chore to be any better than Elvis was with all he had going on.

[13:59:58:13]
Really interesting.

[14:00:01:15]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[14:00:11:15]
When Don died this picture was on Larry King twice.

[14:00:24:23]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[14:00:27:19]
Wow.

[14:00:28:01]
Yeah.

[14:00:28:08]
I had people calling me all over the place.

[14:00:32:23]
I've seen you on Larry King.

[14:00:33:22]
I don't know what I had done.

[14:00:36:02]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[14:00:39:07]
What a national treasure that Don Nott's was.

[14:00:41:11]
Well he was awesome.

[14:00:42:10]
In real life though he was totally quiet humble.

[14:00:45:13]
You're right.

[14:00:47:04]
Yes he was when I went to meet him the first time I expected to meet Barney Fife but it was somebody totally different.

[14:00:56:13]
Yeah.

[14:00:57:08]
Meetings are commonly that often if they know how to pull on your heartstrings they tend to be a lot more introspective.

[14:01:06:13]
Well I've noticed because I've known a lot of them over the years and older ones and if they were you know kind of snippy type people in real life they that's the parts that they usually played.

[14:01:18:12]
I'm not sure if that's a good.

[14:01:47:02]
Everybody.

[14:01:49:02]
I'm going to go ahead and get started.

[14:01:57:02]
And the guys are happy that never got to meet him but Elvis famously came down someone was listening to a record in his house came down and said what is this?

[14:02:12:02]
And he saw the name of the band and the label and said oh it goes clever.

[14:02:17:01]
I'm like "Who's in there David?"

[14:02:20:01]
Should we head over to the office and--  Now y'all what do y'all y'all order pizza for lunch or something like that or?

[14:02:29:19]
We should probably think about what kind of food we want to get here.

[14:02:32:12]
Well y'all just let me know we'll get it.

[14:02:34:09]
Yeah well I mean--  You're not gonna get it I'll get it so.

[14:02:37:23]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[14:02:58:23]
I apologize about the mess.

[14:03:01:14]
It won't look like this in about six months.

[14:03:05:14]
I'm building a wood shop.

[14:03:08:00]
Well but my wood shop will be up there.

[14:03:11:17]
That's why all this stuff is going to leave.

[14:03:15:22]
See my car.

[14:03:16:11]
We bought that we were 16.

[14:03:17:22]
Yeah.

[14:03:19:14]
Yeah.

[14:03:20:22]
Yeah.

[14:03:21:22]
Yeah.

[14:03:23:08]
Yeah I guess so.

[14:03:29:03]
We lost him didn't we?

[14:03:32:22]
We lost him didn't we?

[14:03:34:22]
[ Pause ] [INAUDIBLE] [silence]

[14:04:26:08]
I'm going to go to the next one.

[14:04:54:14]
So what we're gonna do about food.

[14:05:02:13]
Where is the Janelle McCall letters?

[14:05:07:13]
They're right there.

[14:05:08:05]
I was looking for them.

[14:05:09:12]
They're right there somewhere.

[14:05:10:15]
It's actually already out right there.

[14:05:12:14]
Why?

[14:05:13:16]
Somewhere.

[14:05:14:05]
The books I don't have.

[14:05:16:07]
Huh?

[14:05:17:19]
Well that was in my Eaton's collection that I bought.
