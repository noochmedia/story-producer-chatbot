[13:03:37:08]
Great.

[13:03:38:08]
First and foremost can you put the clapper up?

[13:03:46:08]
Spread the sticks.

[13:03:52:08]
And how?

[13:03:55:09]
There you go.

[13:03:56:08]
Tell us your name and then  I'm Karen Walker.

[13:04:07:08]
Welcome to the movies.

[13:04:07:08]
So again all your answers will be in the lens if you don't mind if you find yourself talking to me directly.

[13:04:17:10]
It's fine.

[13:04:17:23]
Okay. little more engaging.

[13:04:21:09]
So again tell us you two happen to look a lot alike.

[13:04:27:03]
Tell me about your family and where you guys live now.

[13:04:34:07]
Well we live in northeast Alabama.

[13:04:43:07]
Got a husband and three children two girls and a boy.

[13:04:48:07]
Got four grandchildren and just had a new great grandbaby.

[13:04:53:07]
Little girl.

[13:04:55:07]
And you both live there?

[13:04:57:07]
Yes I live in northeast Alabama also. also actually in the Boaz area.

[13:05:04:06]
I have four granddaughters they're all married they've got their families and we've lived there for a long time.

[13:05:12:09]
We love Alabama.

[13:05:14:17]
And how did you guys find yourself interested in Pastor Bob's Church?

[13:05:21:02]
We found it online.

[13:05:24:12]
Were you seeking serpents or was it the conspiracy theory that caught your attention?

[13:05:30:15]
It was the sermons with me.

[13:05:34:15]
No with me it was all actually March of last year and just a lot of a lot of things going on in my life and I've run across them on YouTube and I knew I had to go to that church.

[13:05:57:15]
I just had to go be in church with him and I had to tell him thank you for preaching the truth because there's not a lot of preachers nowadays that that would tell you the truth about everything about God.

[13:06:14:12]
We've been going since October we went back in December and my sister went with me and we had been going every month most of the time two times a month now.

[13:06:29:12]
It's about a seven-hour trip and it's a good trip.

[13:06:34:16]
Seven hours each way?

[13:06:36:16]
Yes.

[13:06:38:16]
And you do that twice a month?

[13:06:40:16]
Yes.

[13:06:42:16]
So then you introduced the church to your sister here?

[13:06:45:16]
Is that what happened?

[13:06:46:16]
I did.

[13:06:48:16]
Actually what happened back in 2016 I was introduced to Pastor Bob Joyce through my brother and his wife.

[13:06:59:16]
They wanted me to listen to this man and listen to his voice.

[13:07:06:15]
So I did and I knew at that moment I knew what I heard.

[13:07:11:15]
So as the years go by we'd listen to the sermons and my sister Sherry had went first in October but I didn't feel like I needed to go at that point.

[13:07:26:03]
I didn't want to run on her parade or whatever but then there's some things happened in my life.

[13:07:34:10]
I had lost my husband two and a half years ago so I was at a point in time in my life that I needed to know what God wanted me to do.

[13:07:44:06]
So I had a long talk with God and the conversation what I felt like I needed to do led me to Pastor Bob Joyce's church.

[13:07:58:10]
And that was eight days later after I had my conversation with God And been there ever since.

[13:08:06:03]
And my life has drastically changed and in a different area than I've ever been.

[13:08:15:04]
And that's it's my new journey.

[13:08:17:15]
And Pastor Bob the love that that church has for everybody it's a drawing you know and it's like one big family.

[13:08:28:22]
And that's where I'm at now you know and doing the things that we've done to celebration for his album last night.

[13:08:36:15]
And I've got a whole big family that's tied into Pastor Bob's church and I'll continue on.

[13:08:42:22]
This is an exciting time to be alive the things that's going on in the world today.

[13:08:50:09]
But the one that knows the ending to everything is God Almighty.

[13:08:54:15]
That's my path and I'm gonna stick to it.

[13:08:58:03]
I'm very thankful very thankful.

[13:09:01:03]
Yes.

[13:09:01:23]
Tell me about that church family and how it differs from other churches that you've been to before.

[13:09:07:23]
There is such love there.

[13:09:10:23]
It's like when you meet people they're from all over the world all over the United States.

[13:09:17:22]
And it's like you've known them all your life.

[13:09:21:22]
It's like a magnetic connection that you just feel the Spirit of God so strong. and you can't wait to see them and I've cried several times when I've actually headed home because you just get so close to them it's like nothing I've ever experienced before.

[13:09:43:02]
Well not only I love the United States we've had people from all over England we've got some friends in France Australia it is and it seems like everybody that does come and we have our conversations with them everybody's saying the same thing.

[13:10:01:15]
It's like a spiritual drawing and that's it.

[13:10:06:10]
And God has showed us this that we are connected and it's like hand picking individuals from different all over the world and bringing us together to Pastor Bob's church.

[13:10:18:17]
And unless you feel it the connection with people you don't know what I'm talking about.

[13:10:26:10]
You have to feel that.

[13:10:28:05]
And this is a very spiritual time to be alive and for God to use us in what?

[13:10:36:08]
I don't know yet but I believe one day we will know.

[13:10:40:07]
It's just wonderful.

[13:10:41:08]
It's just great.

[13:10:42:15]
So what's the experience like on a Sunday morning typical Sunday morning in the church?

[13:10:46:06]
Well we get there about eight o'clock and go in and talk to the ones that are familiar.

[13:10:58:16]
And then the visitor starts coming in and we just connect a lot of times just like family with the visitors and we'll sit and talk to them.

[13:11:14:05]
And a lot of them would tell me that you know I feel like that I've been in a service already before the service gets started and yeah we try to meet everybody at least tell them hello and make them feel welcome and and a lot of times they'll write right on post that you know thank you I've never felt such love and in the Spirit of God and then when he gets started playing the piano and singing I believe I go up to heaven and heaven comes down.

[13:11:51:13]
There's nothing in the world like it.

[13:11:53:05]
You can't really steal.

[13:11:54:01]
No.

[13:11:54:21]
I've always had a deep desire to worship God in a certain way.

[13:12:02:20]
And God has put us in a place to where there's total freedom.

[13:12:09:15]
If we want to raise our hands nobody looks funny at us.

[13:12:13:23]
If we want to shout nobody looks funny at us.

[13:12:17:15]
I mean they're right there with us.

[13:12:19:15]
It's just you can feel the Spirit of God all over that church house.

[13:12:24:16]
And there's nothing like it.

[13:12:26:15]
And then the preaching the preaching he preaches truth he's all about God.

[13:12:33:13]
It's all about him. and he preaches that Jesus loves us.

[13:12:40:01]
And sometimes man will set limits on Jesus' love.

[13:12:45:01]
You have to do this and you have to do that or God'll get mad at you.

[13:12:52:01]
That's not the way God is.

[13:12:54:01]
That's not the way he works.

[13:12:56:16]
He's all about love.

[13:12:58:23]
And that's what the whole church is about.

[13:13:02:09]
And it's an experience that you just gotta be there to know it.

[13:13:08:18]
And it's wonderful.

[13:13:12:01]
And too as you're meeting people you can tell some different people come in and we try to welcome everybody.

[13:13:22:03]
Then you find out what their musicians and this and that they're tied in to the music part of it.

[13:13:28:16]
And we have found out how some of them were and it's very amazing that they would come and wanna listen and be in church with Pastor Bob.

[13:13:37:11]
And I know they love the music we did too.

[13:13:39:23]
And that's just part of it.

[13:13:42:08]
But it's just awesome I wouldn't take anything for the experience that we have experienced our life has changed so much.

[13:13:50:18]
And it's like it's took us to another level of spirit been in the spirit with Bob.

[13:13:54:22]
Spirituality.

[13:13:56:09]
There's no judgmental nobody judges anybody there. and everybody seems like they've had their own story then they start telling us their personal stories and most people that's been there has been through some bad experiences in life.

[13:14:13:05]
But for some reason God has connected us all together to join and to spread that love.

[13:14:20:00]
And it's genuine it's not fake love it's genuine.

[13:14:23:17]
No matter what you've been through no matter who you are who you've been It boils down to the fact that it's love and it's God.

[13:14:31:07]
It's just all God.

[13:14:32:15]
Do you commonly see a transformation in especially first timers who show up to see Elvis and instead find Jesus?

[13:14:43:15]
Oh yes.

[13:14:44:11]
Tell me that.

[13:14:45:07]
Oh yes.

[13:14:46:03]
There's been several well you know same like most of the people that does come you know wanna see if Pastor Bob's Elvis.

[13:14:53:16]
But when you get in there that leaves.

[13:14:56:21]
It did me personally it left.

[13:14:58:14]
Of course you know I was curious but I've always in my heart I've known that was him and felt like it was but that didn't matter anymore.

[13:15:08:08]
That was the entertainer.

[13:15:11:02]
The spiritual is so much more I'm telling you.

[13:15:15:00]
For somebody to touch all over the world as an entertainer this is big this is huge.

[13:15:23:06]
And especially this time that we're at the era of time we're living in right now who more could get attention all over the world you know to put his message out there you know about God.

[13:15:36:18]
But yes people come in but when they leave majority that we have talked to it's not about Elvis it's about God.

[13:15:47:07]
I had one to personally tell me he traveled from Texas to meet Elvis but that he's leaving knowing Pastor Bob.

[13:16:00:01]
It's all about God.

[13:16:03:20]
Are you guys worried at all about the church as it continues to grow changing or losing it?

[13:16:13:20]
Or is there any concern about the enthusiasm or excitement?

[13:16:18:19]
Nope just excited.

[13:16:20:19]
We're just excited.

[13:16:21:19]
No.

[13:16:22:19]
You know there's room for growth.

[13:16:26:00]
And as long as everybody stays where God wants us in our life life you know don't get a big head so to speak you know where I come from it's what we say.

[13:16:37:13]
No this is going to spread.

[13:16:40:05]
Don't live by one incline it's going to change.

[13:16:44:19]
You know?

[13:16:45:04]
Do people think you guys are crazy for traveling seven hours to church?

[13:16:51:01]
Yes.

[13:16:52:04]
Yes.

[13:16:52:21]
Yes but you know when you know you know and there's friends and family think that we're I guess that I swayed her to be crazy but until God shows you when God shows you it don't matter who you go where God tells you to go.

[13:17:15:01]
No matter what.

[13:17:16:01]
Right?

[13:17:17:01]
It's wonderful right?

[13:17:18:01]
It's great.

[13:17:19:01]
Yeah.

[13:17:20:01]
I think that's it ladies.

[13:17:21:01]
Well thank you.

[13:17:22:01]
Thank you so much.

[13:17:23:01]

[13:17:24:01]

[13:17:25:01]

[13:17:35:14]
Oh Lordy I don't know. (laughs)  Can you think of one?

[13:17:43:01]
It's just so mean I have to make that.

[13:17:46:04]
Oh very humble.

[13:17:47:23]
Yeah.

[13:17:48:19]
Oh very humble.

[13:17:50:22]
And he's backward more backward than what I was expecting.

[13:17:54:19]
But he's gonna make sure that everybody when you come in and everybody's in there sitting down and Pastor Bob comes through the doors but he makes sure he shakes your hand and he greets you and welcome you to the church.

[13:18:09:14]
No he's just down to earth.

[13:18:13:05]
That's what won me over.

[13:18:15:02]
We're just all different.

[13:18:18:10]
We're all the same we're all humans.

[13:18:20:18]
We all got different lives that we've played roles in our lives but he's just down to earth.

[13:18:25:22]
And that is the biggest thing I guess that I'm like okay I'm good with this.

[13:18:31:00]
That's great.

[13:18:33:04]
Perfect.
