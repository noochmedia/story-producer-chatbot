[13:32:02:15]

Rebecca Costa.

[13:32:08:16]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:32:18:16]
I'm from Texarkana Texas.

[13:32:27:08]
And I'm a pediatric home health nurse.

[13:32:30:21]
And I started attending Household of Faith in April of this year 2024. [inaudible] you you [ Silence ] you [BLANK_AUDIO] [BLANK_AUDIO] [ Silence ] [BLANK_AUDIO] [ Silence ] [BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:34:30:22]
I'm from Texas and I started.

[13:34:37:08]
[INAUDIBLE]

[13:34:41:03]
Okay that's what I was gonna ask you.

[13:34:42:18]
You've heard I look okay.

[13:34:44:04]
I'm from Texas and I started attending House of Faith April of 2024 this year.

[13:34:50:06]
How did you first hear about the church?

[13:34:52:21]
Well my brother come across a song a Pastor Bob called "Coming to Me" and it really spoke to him and he said "You gotta hear this song."

[13:35:02:14]
And he sent me the video actually last year and I looked at it and it was an awesome song.

[13:35:12:02]
And then my brother came in February.

[13:35:15:13]
So after my brother came then I went and listened to the song again. and then I came in April.

[13:35:22:12]
So was it the was it the song was it Pastor Bob or was the original folk the fact that this man sounds like Elvis?

[13:35:34:17]
A combination.

[13:35:37:23]
It was a combination.

[13:35:39:16]
The piano playing the words of the song that make you cry.

[13:35:43:22]
Just the voice the interest of it but there was a drawing to it from the Holy Spirit when you heard the song.

[13:35:56:19]
So tell me about your first time attending the church.

[13:36:01:20]
Well I got there it was a little bit before 8 o'clock got to the door I think I was the third person in line.

[13:36:09:16]
And it was like from the it's indescribable.

[13:36:14:16]
It's from the first hit of that piano to the last day man it was a feeling it was a moving of the Holy Spirit.

[13:36:25:14]
Something if unless you know what it is you can't describe it but you can't fabricate it.

[13:36:32:11]
But I felt a pull that day even though I lived close to two hours away.

[13:36:37:19]
And at that point I'm like I feel a pull this way I don't know how I don't know how it's gonna happen.

[13:36:45:04]
And I had resigned January 1st as a keyboard organ player in Texarkana.

[13:36:52:07]
And so I wasn't playing anywhere.

[13:36:55:06]
And I'm like I prayed about it and I came back.

[13:36:59:21]
And every time I came back I was making a plan when I could come back again.

[13:37:04:19]
So how did you get hooked up in playing in the band?

[13:37:10:04]
Well the fourth Sunday I was there went and talked to the drummer and I told him I said I was picking at him I said you know what you need on that stage?

[13:37:20:18]
I said you need a Hammond organ.

[13:37:22:05]
He threw his hands up.

[13:37:23:08]
Oh Lord yes he said.

[13:37:24:22]
I said I have one.

[13:37:26:04]
He said you have a Hammond organ?

[13:37:28:10]
I said yes.

[13:37:29:23]
I said actually it's a B3 with the 122 Leslie.

[13:37:33:04]
And he said you're kidding.

[13:37:36:02]
So we got to talking and then after Pastor Bob finished taking pictures and signing and was fixing to leave to go to lunch he walked by and he said "Pastor Bob he said "You know what a Haman organ is?"

[13:37:49:12]
And he looked at him and kind of made this face like "Well yeah."

[13:37:53:05]
And then he said "Well do you like them?"

[13:37:55:00]
He said kind of like "Well yeah."

[13:37:57:17]
And he said "She's got one."

[13:37:59:00]
He turned and looked at me and he said "You have a Haman organ?"

[13:38:02:02]
I said "Yes sir."

[13:38:03:22]
And I said "It's in storage right now."

[13:38:05:19]
I said "But I'm fixing by the portable SK-1 dual keyboard this week."

[13:38:12:20]
And he looked at me and he just kind of shook his head.

[13:38:14:22]
He said "Bring it."

[13:38:16:06]
And so two weeks later I was at practice.

[13:38:19:16]
What's it like playing in that band?

[13:38:25:04]
It's an honor.

[13:38:26:21]
Yeah it's songs I grew up in.

[13:38:31:08]
I'm a preacher's kid.

[13:38:32:22]
It's songs I grew up in.

[13:38:34:03]
Like I told Pastor Bob the first day he talked to me he asked me if I knew all those old songs and if I could follow him.

[13:38:39:03]
And I told him I said I'm a preacher's kid that grew up.

[13:38:42:14]
But the preacher the singer would just look at you and say "Give me the key of G."

[13:38:48:08]
And you just followed him.

[13:38:50:11]
And so he asked me if I thought I could follow him.

[13:38:53:07]
And that's how it happened.

[13:38:56:23]
Yeah.

[13:38:57:19]
How would you describe that's your father's musicianship?

[13:39:00:15]
Well I told him that day I loved to hear you play the piano.

[13:39:05:05]
He just kind of agreed.

[13:39:06:06]
He said "I'm not a piano player.

[13:39:07:09]
I just like to bang on it."

[13:39:08:09]
But I disagree with him.

[13:39:10:01]
I used to teach piano and I play by ear and read but I disagree with him.

[13:39:16:12]
He's an amazing he's an amazing pianist.

[13:39:19:06]
Regardless of your love for Pashy Bob the band it's never occurred to you when you're playing music that you made me play without this?

[13:39:32:10]
I'd laugh I said no.

[13:39:33:15]
But you know I've thought about that and I've thought about 'cause I love music.

[13:39:42:06]
I've thought about being on that stage and you put yourself in that thing I'm like what would it have been to have been on the stage with the legend?

[13:39:48:20]
And American Trilogy comes on and you got that full orchestra and the air and the atmosphere and how it would have been.

[13:39:56:17]
But then I think you know what?

[13:39:59:23]
As great as that would have been it's nothing compared.

[13:40:02:13]
Because now it's not about a man.

[13:40:05:06]
It's about the Lord.

[13:40:09:21]
And as you sit there on that stage and you're bringing people into praise and worship it changes things.

[13:40:17:14]
And you realize that even it's not about Pastor Bob it's about Jesus.

[13:40:24:03]
And that's who Pastor Bob points you to as Jesus.

[13:40:27:10]
And it's an honor.

[13:40:29:15]
It doesn't seem real sometimes but it's an honor for such a time as this.

[13:40:35:18]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

[13:40:41:05]
Tell me about the congregation at this church.

[13:40:43:20]
Very friendly very friendly.

[13:40:46:06]
They'll come around they'd come and introduce themselves to you and ask you where you were from.

[13:40:51:09]
And it's just like a family a new family.

[13:40:55:07]
And I said I hate to wish my life away but when I leave on Sunday I'm counting back the days.

[13:41:00:19]
It's time to come back and go to church.

[13:41:02:15]
It's my new family and they're from around the world.

[13:41:07:15]
All the different states.

[13:41:10:07]
It's nothing that I ever thought I would dream that I'd be involved in driving every weekend but it's worth every bit of it.

[13:41:20:14]
Definitely an amazing group of people the little church by the creek.

[13:41:24:10]
How does it differ from the churches you grew up in or churches you attended?

[13:41:30:06]
I grew up in churches that they were friendly people.

[13:41:33:15]
And like I said my dad was a pastor.

[13:41:36:04]
He was shouting "Baptist."

[13:41:37:11]
They said we were too much Baptist to be Pentecostal too much Pentecostal to be Baptist.

[13:41:41:14]
So they called us "Babdicostal."

[13:41:43:04]
Pastor Bob talks about Pentecostal.

[13:41:45:22]
So and a lot of the songs are the same.

[13:41:49:02]
And it's a lot like what I grew up in. just still friendly maybe just more it's odd how like so many people are drawn from different states but yet there's connections.

[13:42:10:18]
Like the fourth Sunday I was there the lady I met was from Franklin and then they come find out she's there's connections with my family here.

[13:42:19:13]
And other people have had connections with different states and it's just like it's like God's bringing people together from different states and it's like we've known each other forever.

[13:42:29:20]
How you brought other people to the church?

[13:42:35:08]
Yes.

[13:42:36:11]
How's that come?

[13:42:37:10]
It's good.

[13:42:38:06]
How did you introduce them to the church?

[13:42:43:01]
Well most of them know I've played I became my dad's organist in the fourth grade and people ask "Where you playing?"

[13:42:50:04]
or "What are you doing now?"

[13:42:51:11]
And I'll tell them and they'll go "You're driving to Benton?"

[13:42:55:03]
I'm like yeah just go Google household of faith Pastor Bob and listen to his music and listen to his singing.

[13:43:02:00]
And they're drawn into it.

[13:43:03:15]
Questions?

[13:43:07:21]
(indistinct) How do you feel about the growth of the church?

[13:43:18:01]
I think it's awesome.

[13:43:19:04]
I think it's awesome because Going back to your question while I go about what you might think or what you might not think it's kind of like I look at it if that was or is the case it's kind of like Saul became Paul.

[13:43:38:05]
And God always has a plan.

[13:43:43:04]
And I believe that there's people that are being reached all around the world because of who they think he may have been that he would not have reached if he'd have just been a little Arkansas preacher with a good voice.

[13:43:59:07]
And I read comments of people like they say "I'm not even a Christian I don't like church "but there's something about you Pastor Bob "and your music and your sermon."

[13:44:10:10]
And he's drawing people to Jesus.

[13:44:12:15]
And what I like about him is he tells you it's not about a man it's about Jesus.

[13:44:18:03]
And I've even had people say "Well do y'all go there to worship or magnify him?"

[13:44:24:14]
I said "No he'll tell you if you're there for that "you're there for the wrong reason.

[13:44:29:08]
"It's not about that."

[13:44:31:01]
And I said "If you ever come and see and hear him "you'll know it's not about him it's about Jesus."

[13:44:36:01]
I've heard him say many times "If you're here for anything other than Jesus "you're here for the wrong reason."

[13:44:42:02]
And I absolutely feel like if he wasn't truthful and that's not the way he was about it the anointing would not be on his life the way it is because he's an amazing anointed man of God for such a time as this.

[13:44:59:16]
And do you see the transformation?

[13:45:02:22]
People who come in curious about illness and leave having found Jesus.

[13:45:06:12]
Yeah you watch their faces and then you watch them drawn into it and then you watch the tears you know and they're like this is unreal.

[13:45:16:17]
I'm like yeah it is.

[13:45:19:18]
That's fantastic.

[13:45:21:13]
You guys did a great excellent job.

[13:45:23:19]
You did a great job.

[13:45:24:15]
Thank you.

[13:45:25:11]
Thank you so much.

[13:45:26:07]
We really appreciate it yeah.

[13:45:27:03]
I didn't say too much.

[13:45:28:11]
Well is there anything else you wanna say Rebecca you feel any mistrust on her?

[13:45:32:08]
I don't think so.

[13:45:33:08]
Okay.

[13:45:34:19]
But I have you know a lot of people might sound stupid I have thought about being on that stage what it would have been to play for him.

[13:45:42:08]
Yeah.

[13:45:43:04]
And then I think but it's more now because you're setting up the other side for the kingdom.

[13:45:50:19]
It's not about the legend anymore.

[13:45:53:23]
It's about him.

[13:45:55:08]
And it's overwhelming at times to think oh my gosh.

[13:46:01:08]
How has it played that bigger crowd in the two games you got?

[13:46:06:01]
Yeah.

[13:46:06:22]
Yeah I was like saying.

[13:46:07:18]
Yeah like I said I've been playing all my life.

[13:46:10:20]
If I know my music I don't care.

[13:46:12:23]
The more that it draws you into it but.

[13:46:16:23]
Yeah it's amazing.

[13:46:20:21]
Wonderful.
