Katherine Fox.

[16:20:13:18]
[ Pause ]

[16:20:28:05]
My name is Katherine Fox.

[16:20:30:00]
I go by Kate or Katie usually at church.

[16:20:32:11]
And I live in Weatherford Oklahoma right now.

[16:20:35:19]
Okay.

[16:20:36:19]
How far away is that from there?

[16:20:39:09]
About five and a half hours.

[16:20:41:00]
How often do you find your way out here?

[16:20:43:13]
every month maybe twice a month sometimes.

[16:20:50:03]
My aunt started sending me YouTube videos asked me to check it out at first I did not believe I was a little skeptical I didn't want to get myself into anything that was too crazy so I did a lot of research I made sure I wanted to I wanted to know what I was getting into.

[16:21:12:17]
I did lots of research about it.

[16:21:17:04]
And when you researched it by the first time you came to the church where were you on the likelihood of who you might have been?

[16:21:25:04]
Oh just from the research?

[16:21:27:04]
I mean can you ever be 100% certain?

[16:21:32:15]
So I mean there was a good chance. just all of the evidence in all the evidence I did discover one thing that Elvis did not die in August of 77.

[16:21:45:12]
I know that 100% from everything that I researched and looked Elvis did not die in August of 77.

[16:21:54:21]
There is there is not I 100% believe Elvis is out there.

[16:22:02:02]
If he wants to be found.

[16:22:03:06]
I think he'll show us.

[16:22:04:17]
I think he'll let us know.

[16:22:06:03]
But I know he's not dead.

[16:22:09:04]
So then the first time you came to the church time without experience?

[16:22:14:18]
Oh it was crazy.

[16:22:17:08]
We sat down towards the back and we got there pretty early.

[16:22:22:09]
Back then it wasn't too crowded so we found a good parking spot good seat and And then it was almost like a feeling.

[16:22:31:21]
We were just sitting there you know people will come up and "Hi how are you?

[16:22:35:10]
Where are you from?"

[16:22:37:02]
And then you just get this feeling.

[16:22:39:11]
And we -- I think we both turned around and looked.

[16:22:42:13]
And he was there.

[16:22:43:18]
It was -- you could feel him as soon as he entered the building.

[16:22:47:07]
It was like a charisma about him that -- and you can to this day.

[16:22:52:03]
Two weeks ago my mom was here and we went out to eat.

[16:22:55:21]
And she said that she just felt something and then she felt chills.

[16:23:01:10]
And then she started punching my arm.

[16:23:03:14]
And she's like he's here.

[16:23:04:21]
He's here.

[16:23:05:10]
And sure enough she turned around.

[16:23:06:21]
And he'd come and he'd sat right beside her and had lunch with us.

[16:23:11:07]
And she was like oh my goodness.

[16:23:13:19]
He could just feel him.

[16:23:14:22]
I don't.

[16:23:19:04]
Oh you're fine.

[16:23:24:13]
Oh I see it came off.

[16:23:25:09]
[ Pause ]

[16:23:43:08]
Okay.

[16:23:43:23]
Okay so the first time you met Pastor Bob what was your reaction?

[16:23:49:23]
I mean I met him just like any other man like a pastor.

[16:23:54:18]
"Hi Pastor how you doing?"

[16:23:56:15]
And "Good to be here ask where we were from."

[16:23:59:18]
And then he shook our hands and walked on.

[16:24:02:11]
And it was pretty amazing but mostly it was after we I think we invited ourselves to lunch.

[16:24:09:14]
Just happened to be at lunch at the same place.

[16:24:13:23]
And afterwards you know he came back up we were walking out and shook his hand said we really enjoyed the service.

[16:24:22:15]
And then he's like "Now where are you from again?"

[16:24:24:18]
and we talked a little bit but it was just at that moment looking into his eyes it was just amazing.

[16:24:33:01]
You could just feel it.

[16:24:35:22]
Was it once you met him that you were more confident you were closer to that 100% that this man used to be?

[16:24:45:13]
Meeting?

[16:24:46:09]
All I get I mean you have to go see.

[16:24:50:14]
That's what I tell everybody.

[16:24:51:18]
Like I can sit here all day and tell you this person's Elvis or this person's Elvis. and this is John Denver but you have to physically be in the building.

[16:25:00:22]
You have to go meet whoever I believe.

[16:25:04:09]
You have to experience the church.

[16:25:06:18]
Do your own research.

[16:25:09:09]
Do your research.

[16:25:11:07]
Visit.

[16:25:11:15]
And then you'll come away with a whole new family.

[16:25:15:21]
The church is like it's like family.

[16:25:19:17]
Yes I felt that.

[16:25:25:18]
I have a napkin too.

[16:25:27:10]
All right.

[16:25:47:12]
Talk about the family.

[16:25:50:08]
They are amazing.

[16:25:51:15]
From the first moment we walked in the church people have basically taken me in hand.

[16:25:57:04]
One time my car died on a Sunday.

[16:26:00:17]
And then I just had a family that-- first they took me to a hotel room.

[16:26:05:01]
I said no they want to take me home.

[16:26:06:18]
I was like oh it's fine.

[16:26:08:11]
I had my two dogs in the car which aren't little.

[16:26:12:03]
So they were like well just come over here.

[16:26:13:22]
I was like well I have a hotel room.

[16:26:15:16]
If something happens later on-- And sure enough they had to keep it for another two days.

[16:26:21:02]
So they were like nope you were staying with us.

[16:26:23:19]
So they loaded up my two dogs and me and took me home and fed me.

[16:26:28:15]
And we just had the best time.

[16:26:30:20]
Just about anybody in church they would do anything for you.

[16:26:35:21]
I would do anything for them.

[16:26:37:10]
They're just amazing amazing people.

[16:26:40:19]
Have you brought anyone else for church?

[16:26:45:02]
Just my mom my mom and nephew actually.

[16:26:47:10]
They loved it.

[16:26:50:00]
My mom 100% believes it's him.

[16:26:55:07]
My nephew he was younger.

[16:26:56:16]
It was a Christmas party.

[16:26:58:03]
It was for the Christmas party.

[16:27:00:10]
And he got to come and meet Pastor Bob and he still talks about it.

[16:27:05:10]
It's amazing.

[16:27:07:09]
So do you still come this distance because he's Elvis or because he's Pastor Bob?

[16:27:11:09]
Oh Pastor Bob. 100% the church.

[16:27:15:13]
The church is its family like I said.

[16:27:18:03]
I get excited every time I go.

[16:27:20:09]
And then you know there's always a plus side in the singing the music.

[16:27:26:09]
You just totally forget about you know maybe he is Elvis.

[16:27:30:09]
And then every now and then you have that moment or you look into his eyes or he just does something. you're like "Oh my goodness that could be Elvis."

[16:27:41:13]
You just forget because he's just Pastor Bob to us.

[16:27:44:18]
That's awesome.

[16:27:46:13]
Yeah.

[16:27:48:09]
So talking about the culture of the church everyone's so inviting and welcoming.

[16:27:52:14]
I'm gonna check the wall.

[16:27:53:09]
Keep asking.

[16:27:55:05]
Go.

[16:27:55:05]
Everyone's so inviting and welcoming.

[16:27:58:15]
The question is why does the culture exist?

[16:28:02:10]
Where does it come from?

[16:28:04:21]
So we had a church where we lived in Anchorage and it was full of military people and military people you know they come from all over.

[16:28:12:21]
You don't have your family so your church kind of becomes your family and I think that's a little bit of what's happening here.

[16:28:22:07]
People come from all over.

[16:28:23:14]
I mean sometimes I talk to these people more than I talk to my own family.

[16:28:29:00]
I just they're amazing.

[16:28:31:01]
They're an amazing family.

[16:28:32:22]
I think yes.

[16:28:35:22]
Do you have any fun stories you'd like to share like about Pastor Bob?

[16:28:46:22]
I don't I don't think so.

[16:28:50:21]
[Question from the audience]

[16:29:18:02]
Oh yes and you see it more oh my goodness.

[16:29:21:07]
I don't even look anymore.

[16:29:22:12]
I don't look for Elvis anymore.

[16:29:25:14]
I don't research that.

[16:29:28:03]
I mean I know he's alive.

[16:29:31:14]
Like I said if he wants to be found he will be found.

[16:29:34:21]
But right now with everything that's here I think my life is very full here.

[16:29:41:21]
So is there a side of it too that makes you nervous as well?

[16:29:44:21]
Oh yes oh yes.

[16:29:46:17]
Every Sunday sometimes you will there'll be a commotion or something you're just like...

[16:29:52:11]
I there's yeah sometimes you wonder.

[16:30:01:02]
I mean anybody now will do anything to get their name out there.

[16:30:06:21]
We've seen that every day you know.

[16:30:08:21]
If he is Elvis could you imagine?

[16:30:12:07]
There's a lot of people that want to see that.

[16:30:19:07]
[ Pause ]

[16:30:22:07]
Okay.

[16:30:23:07]
Anything else you want to share?

[16:30:25:07]
No that's good.

[16:30:26:07]
I'm good.

[16:30:27:07]
I'm good.

[16:30:28:07]
[ Laughter ]
