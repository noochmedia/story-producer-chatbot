[02:37:12:21]
We're gonna open that up.

[02:37:15:19]
What's your name?

[02:37:16:12]
All right now Jenna tell us your age your grade where you live 15 and I'm from Arkansas and I live in Britain Do you attend this church?

[02:37:38:08]
Yeah okay How did you tell me a little bit about yourself?

[02:37:42:10]
What do you do?

[02:37:42:19]
I'm a big Elvis fan and I do a lot of research on it so I knew about the Bob Joyce like coincidences before I met his grandson and then I met him and we got on the conversation of it he was like that's my grandpa so that's kind of how it all started.

[02:38:00:06]
Do you go to school together?

[02:38:00:15]
Yes.

[02:38:01:13]
Tell me that because my voice won't be on there.

[02:38:02:22]
We go to school together at ACA.

[02:38:05:22]
So what happened you knew about it from online and did you approach him to talk about it?

[02:38:10:03]
It kind of just started because like a lot of people know that I'm a huge Elvis fan so we got on the topic and we started talking about like if he's still alive or not and then I got on topic of Bob Joyce.

[02:38:22:17]
Amazing.

[02:38:24:08]
So do you think Pastor Bob Joyce is Elvis?

[02:38:28:17]
I wish but I don't think so.

[02:38:30:17]
[Laughter]

[02:38:32:17]
Fair enough.

[02:38:34:23]
Tell me what kind of an Elvis fan are you?

[02:38:36:19]
Have you been to Graceland?

[02:38:37:17]
Yes I've been to Graceland six times.

[02:38:39:17]
Oh my goodness.

[02:38:41:17]
All right.

[02:38:41:17]
What's your favorite Elvis album?

[02:38:43:17]
Moody Blue What is it?

[02:38:47:09]
Moody Blue What's your favorite Elvis movie?

[02:38:49:21]
I like the new one that he came out with but I also like Viva Las Vegas Right on So what do you think about the similarities between Pastor Bob and Elvis?

[02:38:57:20]
I think that like the singing and similarities are nice but the age difference is not as much of a coincidence Do you ever go down those internet rabbit holes though and go "Oh my goodness maybe?"

[02:39:10:10]
Yes.

[02:39:11:10]
Okay so the age thing definitely sort of kills it for you.

[02:39:16:10]
Yes.

[02:39:17:10]
Yeah.

[02:39:18:10]
Do you like Pastor Bob singing then?

[02:39:19:10]
I do.

[02:39:20:10]
Okay.

[02:39:21:10]

[02:39:23:10]
