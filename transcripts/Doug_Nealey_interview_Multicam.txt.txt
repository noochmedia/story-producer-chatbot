[12:09:22:05]
And then if you want to slate yourself go ahead and hold it right up in front of you.

[12:09:38:16]

[12:09:39:03]
Sorry about that.

[12:09:40:03]
And then open it up.

Looks like you've seen the movies yep.

[12:09:44:03]

[12:09:47:03]

[12:09:49:03]
So will I look at you or the camera?

[12:09:51:03]
Look at the camera.

[12:09:52:03]
Okay.

[12:09:54:03]
So once again tell us your name and where you live Doug.

[12:10:00:03]
My name is Doug Neely and I live in Georgia.

[12:10:04:02]
Right on.

[12:10:05:02]
How did you first hear about this church you're attending?

[12:10:09:02]
In 2023 I had a good friend.

[12:10:13:02]
She was talking to me one day.

[12:10:15:02]
It was around the holidays.

[12:10:16:02]
She had mentioned Bob Joyce which she's always been an Elvis fan like me.

[12:10:22:02]
We were talking and I've never been a fan of Elvis Impostors or whatever.

[12:10:32:02]
So she told me about Bob.

[12:10:34:09]
So I began you know the first video I ever seen was the 2011 video of American Trilogy.

[12:10:43:23]
And I listened to that video so that intrigued me to start wanting to listen to Bob's sermons that were posted online.

[12:10:52:15]
So I began the listening and you know doing a little research.

[12:10:58:02]
I went all the way to October of 2024 where I first came to my first visit to the church.

[12:11:07:16]
So for how long were you watching him online?

[12:11:10:06]
From probably December to October of 2024.

[12:11:14:20]
So wait let me back up then.

[12:11:17:04]
So tell me about your so you're an Elvis fan.

[12:11:20:07]
Yes sir.

[12:11:21:04]
All right tell me about what Elvis has meant to you in your life.

[12:11:24:14]
I just looked at Elvis as a caring generous person that usually gave more than I always imagined him being great to his fans.

[12:11:36:22]
And he was always singing gospel music which I loved.

[12:11:41:10]
And he's just been a big inspiration to me through the years.

[12:11:47:07]
So did you grow up in a church?

[12:11:49:01]
Yes sir.

[12:11:49:22]
Okay all right.

[12:11:50:23]
So you have did you have a do you have a home church in Georgia?

[12:11:54:12]
Yes sir.

[12:11:55:12]
What's your home church?

[12:11:56:12]
It's Harvest Missionary.

[12:11:57:12]
Okay.

[12:11:58:12]
And then so but yet on was it closed for COVID or were you just seeking just because it was an Elvis?

[12:12:07:21]
Pretty much just curious you know of seeing and we were already a plan to visit to Louisiana.

[12:12:16:02]
So we had a my friend had a friend that lived in Little Rock so we came and visited him after a surgery and we ended up at the church the next day.

[12:12:27:18]
So we got to meet all in one visit.

[12:12:31:07]
So what was the experience when you first started researching him online?

[12:12:35:10]
Just pretty much people started comparing the voice and you know I never really thought through the years much about Elvis being alive or anything but you know it's always been in your mind that there could be a possibility of that.

[12:12:55:05]
Well she my friend that told me about him when I first heard American Trilogy I mean the voices you know so Elvis' voice is just one in a million or billion.

[12:13:13:14]
Right on.

[12:13:15:12]
All right so tell me about your first experience at the church then.

[12:13:18:01]
First visit we came to the church that morning and Bob he was the first one there at the church but we were all afraid to go in.

[12:13:26:22]
So and we've seen him come through the door.

[12:13:30:03]
So it was pretty you know we all were all in awe when he walked by but we didn't really try to go in until the next couple of people came to the church 'cause we didn't know about outside visitors or if anybody visited that often or other than local people.

[12:13:49:17]
So when you saw him for the first time did you already think this man might be Elvis?

[12:13:57:16]
Did you have doubts?

[12:13:59:11]
Were you 100%?

[12:14:01:03]
How was it different once you saw him in person?

[12:14:03:05]
Well you always doubt but you know You always look for the things that you've seen online and voice comparison and the broken pinkies Elvis had and all the other features that are similar to Elvis.

[12:14:20:17]
But you never really think that Elvis would still be here today.

[12:14:26:16]
So when you saw him in person did you change your tune?

[12:14:31:12]
Well he walks up first.

[12:14:34:09]
That's his big thing when people come to church.

[12:14:36:21]
He wants to meet everyone and know who they are what they do.

[12:14:42:12]
He's just the most gracious and thankful person that you can ever meet.

[12:14:48:12]
Did you have the sense that the Internet might be right when you finally met Paul?

[12:14:57:03]
in a way and you know the more research you do and compared to Elvis features and all I mean everything lines up to him being who he is.

[12:15:10:15]
Hey Brian can we check his love mic?

[12:15:16:01]
Is it rubbing or?

[12:15:17:01]
Yeah.

[12:15:18:01]
[ Pause ]

[12:15:27:01]
I want you to see it.

[12:15:28:00]
That's the thing.

[12:15:28:12]
[ Pause ]

[12:15:33:00]
Is that okay my friend?

[12:15:34:00]
Yeah we're fine.

[12:15:34:12]
[ Pause ]

[12:15:43:12]
So how many times have you attended the church since that first time?

[12:15:46:00]
This is my 36th visit. from Georgia so nine hours of 36 trips so that's a lot of travel.

[12:15:54:12]
That's 36 trips in how many months?

[12:15:59:12]
In approximately four years going on four years now.

[12:16:03:12]
I try to come once a month but maybe once every two months.

[12:16:08:12]
Tell me about the other fellow congregants the bond you have with this group.

[12:16:14:11]
From the first time we came you know everybody acted like family.

[12:16:20:11]
They received everybody.

[12:16:21:11]
You know that's still the way it is today.

[12:16:24:11]
You meet so many people from local to all around the country even across the world from Australia to Brazil Italy.

[12:16:33:11]
People come from everywhere just to see Bob.

[12:16:38:11]
And how is that sort of extended family?

[12:16:44:20]
Everybody one big group hangs out a lot.

[12:16:49:01]
And we get to go do stuff together and we just enjoy everybody's fellowship.

[12:16:56:04]
And we all enjoy learning about each other and how they got here and how I became here to the church.

[12:17:05:17]
Talk about Bob as a pastor.

[12:17:08:17]
Pastor Bob he's just I say it all the time that he's pretty much a genius.

[12:17:15:07]
And he is just the most godly man that you can possibly ever meet.

[12:17:21:14]
He loves Jesus more than anybody I've ever met.

[12:17:26:02]
That's his main focus.

[12:17:28:00]
As soon as you walk through the door Bob he's always there to tell people it's all about Jesus.

[12:17:35:02]
It never matters but the only thing he wants to do is spread Jesus and make his church grow and lead people to Jesus.

[12:17:45:22]
He's never claimed to be somebody who isn't.

[12:17:49:06]
He's never claimed to be.

[12:17:51:16]
People say he's Elvis but he's never claimed to be.

[12:17:55:03]
I think he says if anything can lead people to Jesus and if people think something that's them but as long as he gets to them and can lead.

[12:18:08:13]
I think he's you know the only man on earth that could lead a billion to two billion people to Christ and Jesus and you know if people can come into the church I think that's his main purpose.

[12:18:23:10]
Yeah I mean we get to go hang out with him and have dinner with him lunch and He's just he's got the best sense of humor.

[12:18:35:21]
He's always joking around.

[12:18:37:11]
He's such a genius.

[12:18:40:16]
He knows pretty much a lot of topics.

[12:18:43:15]
And he likes to go in detail explaining.

[12:18:47:04]
He's just the most respected person.

[12:18:51:00]
I mean he gives full respect to anybody.

[12:18:53:22]
He loves to meet people and just learn who they are.

[12:18:58:22]
And it don't matter who it is.

[12:19:01:02]
He enjoys just seeing smiles on everybody's face and bringing happiness to everybody.

[12:19:07:17]
So when you hang out with Pastor Bob do you feel like you're hanging out with Bob or do you think you're hanging out with Elvis?

[12:19:13:21]
You know I just think of Bob.

[12:19:16:08]
I don't even think of Elvis really.

[12:19:18:05]
I mean you pretty much forget once you get to know Bob.

[12:19:21:12]
And you know I think that's his main thing.

[12:19:24:04]
You're actually getting to know the real person and not somebody that if he was And you know I respect that.

[12:19:32:03]
And I think if Elvis is as great as Bob you know personality I think you know the world's in for a great blessing.

[12:19:44:01]
Any stories of hanging out with Bob that sort of felt like sort of a tongue-in-cheek nod to who he may have been in a past life?

[12:19:53:20]
He don't really -- he'll you know he's kind of -- I don't know he's just fun to hang out with.

[12:20:04:01]
He don't really go into much detail.

[12:20:07:08]
But he's all about song.

[12:20:08:12]
He's constantly singing.

[12:20:09:19]
I mean every time you're really around Bob he's singing some type of song.

[12:20:15:02]
And then you know you talk to him and he talks about you know certain celebrities and it's just like you kind of absorb you know the knowledge that he brings.

[12:20:25:17]
How do you tell other friends that ask why you're going to Arkansas to church?

[12:20:32:07]
What do you tell them you're up to?

[12:20:33:23]
Most people think I'm crazy.

[12:20:36:01]
First off they say you pass a lot of churches going from Georgia to Arkansas.

[12:20:42:17]
I just tell them about Bob and how much he loves Jesus.

[12:20:48:13]
There's only one man if he is who he was. shows to you that he loves Jesus more than anything.

[12:20:57:11]
I mean it's just an inspiration just to be able to see that.

[12:21:01:11]
And it's like seeing a walking miracle every time that we walk through the doors or you're even around him.

[12:21:08:00]
Yeah what do you think that would mean to the world if this guy gave up everything to follow Jesus in his way?

[12:21:14:18]
You know there's fans I know that probably would be upset with him but I think there would be more people happy to know that He lived life for Jesus and He's bringing all these people and I think He's one of the main people in the world that could bring the world together and bring peace and happiness and show that there's eternal life and how much He can spread the gospel and just the beauty of what a life He lived away from startlements spotlight and just being able to be a normal person.

[12:21:49:06]
What's your favorite Bob Joy story?

[12:21:51:18]
I guess the first time I met him it was just like you never know what to expect but he's just so kind and gracious.

[12:22:03:12]
He accepts anybody that walks through the door.

[12:22:07:21]
And I noticed I'm sure he does that with everyone but He kind of like studies you kind of with his eyes.

[12:22:14:21]
And you know I guess he's trying to figure out you know your intentions but he's all about I mean from the time I walked through the doors he's all been about Jesus.

[12:22:24:14]
And he said that's his main purpose in life is spreading the gospel.

[12:22:29:18]
Yeah when you say his intentions like is there unfortunately people that show up for just the Elvis component and not the Pastor Bob?

[12:22:37:19]
Oh yeah you see it.

[12:22:39:03]
I mean there's people that go to his house and I'm sure they're the stalkers type.

[12:22:47:10]
And I know that probably affects him and especially safety.

[12:22:52:06]
That's my biggest thing is protecting Bob and being there for him.

[12:22:56:06]
And if he ever needs anything I can be there as a friend and be able just to help his mission to just spread the gospel and just be there.

[12:23:06:20]
Yeah do you and your friends have a sense that you are there to help protect him and shield him?

[12:23:13:20]
Yeah pretty much.

[12:23:14:18]
I mean us as a tight group I mean we you pretty much study people come in and I mean you hear stories of people or see stories online of people possibly making threats and you know that's kind of disturbing to know that your friend is you know trying to bring peace and love and joy just the gospel to everybody and then people are mad because if he was that person you know it's pretty sad that they can't honor.

[12:23:47:20]
Most people you know huge Elvis fans you know they couldn't accept that he was still alive and they would probably you know blame him for but you know they've got to look past that and look who he really is. intention in life was to serve God and you know spread the gospel to everyone.

[12:24:09:21]
Alright so what percentage are you on whether Pastor Bob is Elvis Presley?

[12:24:15:21]
I'm probably a thousand percent but I mean that's just me but I know him as Bob I never knew he passed away you know that Elvis part and and I you know I greatly appreciate you know him letting me be part of his life and just be part of the church and just be a friend to him.

[12:24:37:11]
That's my main love for Bob is you know just seeing how an extraordinary man an individual can just be so inspirational.

[12:24:47:20]
And just people from all over the world just love him love him Bob.

[12:24:52:19]
And you know they come and I guess they expect one thing but they see another as just a normal man that loves to serve God.

[12:25:03:18]
That's fantastic.

[12:25:06:14]
How many how many what would you say the percentage of congregants are that think that do think that he's Elvis?

[12:25:14:23]
Probably regular guests 100 percent.

[12:25:18:16]
But you know there's very few you know it's local that live.

[12:25:26:01]
But there have been several that's moved from other states or wherever in just to be part of you know the local congregation.

[12:25:34:10]
But I say it's bent in itself I would say maybe a quarter of the church possibly.

[12:25:41:09]
And so when people have sort of uprooted their lives for him would you say it's because it's because they want to be near Elvis the circus they want to be near Pastor Bob?

[12:25:50:22]
I'd say the Elvis effect they're just huge fans.

[12:25:54:14]
I mean like he says if he can lead people to Christ it don't matter what the situation is that's his main goal.

[12:26:04:01]
And whether they think that he is or not I mean he's just gonna give a blessing.

[12:26:09:20]
And his word every Sunday is just incredible.

[12:26:15:08]
I mean he goes into detail and just one little verse or something might mean a lot.

[12:26:21:22]
And it's explaining how he goes into detail of his sermons.

[12:26:26:22]
It's just incredible.

[12:26:28:17]
How has being associated with this church changed your life?

[12:26:32:08]
It gave me a better outlook.

[12:26:34:13]
I see that materialistic stuff don't mean nothing.

[12:26:38:14]
If eternal life is not there I mean I see it in Bob all the time.

[12:26:44:22]
And you know if he could give up everything what he'd done and you know he was Bob longer than he was if he is.

[12:26:55:01]
I mean it's just a blessing just to know that materialistic stuff mean nothing and put God first in everything we do.

[12:27:04:13]
And it's just it's incredible.

[12:27:07:13]
It's like a walking miracle every time you see him.

[12:27:11:01]
Fantastic.

[12:27:13:19]
Any questions for you Brian?

[12:27:14:19]
So good you covered most of them.

[12:27:16:08]
Yeah.

[12:27:16:20]
Please look at him Brian.

[12:27:22:05]
Okay cool.

[12:27:22:17]
What would you say to there's people out there that say that Pastor Bob is pretending to be Elvis just for his own fame or money or success.

[12:27:34:08]
I mean how would you respond to that?

[12:27:35:19]
I totally disagree with him cuz you know I know him Bob and He is so adamant letting people know that he takes nothing.

[12:27:44:22]
The man I mean he lives in a little house.

[12:27:47:20]
He don't have no luxury nothing.

[12:27:50:14]
He just lives for the gospel.

[12:27:52:22]
I mean I've seen people give him gifts just time and about and a lot of times he leaves it at the church.

[12:27:59:17]
I mean it's just nothing.

[12:28:01:21]
I mean it don't mean nothing.

[12:28:03:18]
I mean if you've had the world before And you give up what he did if he was who he was.

[12:28:10:10]
And I mean that just shows you there that the man has no worry about money.

[12:28:16:20]
He just wants his main focus that he wants a bigger church.

[12:28:20:16]
And he says that he wants to donate any money all money that's received on anything to the church.

[12:28:29:04]
That he cares nothing about anything else but Jesus.

[12:28:34:04]
Jesus.

[12:28:37:03]
Usually you know you say about the front doors and there's usually a big crowd every Sunday of different people and You know they're always asking questions and I always say you know you can make your own assumptions and just listen to the man and the voice when he sings.

[12:29:13:18]
I've even told Bob at your church one day that you know he's God's most perfect musical instrument.

[12:29:20:17]
And people when they hear the man sing you know especially the gospel song and how deeply he gets into it.

[12:29:29:12]
I mean when they walk out they tell you how much that God has came into their life just by witnessing the greatness of the gospel that he spreads.

[12:29:44:20]
Usually from when they walk in the door to when they walk out they've got a totally different perception of who he really is.

[12:29:55:14]
I think they came looking for Elvis but they end up looking and knowing that they've witnessed the gospel from a man that gave up everything.

[12:30:06:14]
And I think that means more to them than even meeting the man.

[12:30:11:12]
He stays there an hour two hours at a time after just meeting people just so that they know who prays for everybody there.

[12:30:22:03]
And I think that means more to someone than anything that a man could ever witness in life.

[12:30:30:03]
Is the fact that Pastor Bob could be Elvis is that something that's talked about openly or is it kind of secretive?

[12:30:37:03]
Mostly local members they don't really even talk about it because you know they're so used to him.

[12:30:44:02]
He's normal like we are.

[12:30:46:02]
But the visitor they're always intrigued and looking for I mean they're always excited They're always excited.

[12:30:52:11]
You say the excitement.

[12:30:54:17]
And then I mean everybody local that's friends they just they think of Bob of Bob like I do.

[12:31:02:18]
I don't even look for you know I've known Bob for almost four years now.

[12:31:07:11]
So it's just a blessing just to be friends with Bob.

[12:31:13:22]
Is it fun to introduce someone who's never heard of Bob Joyce the idea of him though?

[12:31:18:09]
Yeah mostly.

[12:31:19:14]
I try to show them you know sermons and I show them you know the stuff that took me there that have been fans.

[12:31:29:15]
I tell them you know to look it up for self and then if they ever watch it sometimes they do sometimes they don't.

[12:31:36:01]
But you know they ask questions and I tell them I said just go and you know witness for yourself because the blessing that you receive just coming in and listening to them is just unreal.

[12:31:47:19]
It is a fun story to introduce people to.

[12:31:52:19]
Oh yeah it's super incredible just knowing that a man of that stature could leave everything just to be you know leave people to Jesus.

[12:32:07:18]
I mean that's his main purpose in life.

[12:32:11:06]
It would take him probably 42 years to finally understand his whole purpose in life.

[12:32:18:06]
Just to know that he was here for a certain reason.

[12:32:23:06]
He always probably questions why he was who he was but in the end he knew.

[12:32:29:06]
That's his main goal is showing everybody that nothing means anything but Jesus and eternal life.

[12:32:39:05]
Would it matter to you at all if we found out that Pastor Bob has not helped us?

[12:32:43:00]
No I wouldn't care.

[12:32:43:20]
I'd still come just regular.

[12:32:46:12]
I mean he's such a great person and friend and he just spreads the gospel like I hear.

[12:32:54:23]
He's like an old timey preacher.

[12:32:57:17]
You know a lot of the new age stuff is so much different.

[12:33:01:12]
He just pretty much goes back to the old gospel and tells you like it is. and that's what I value most about Bob.

[12:33:10:06]
Yeah love it.

[12:33:14:01]
That's fantastic.

[12:33:16:03]
I mean he's just the most incredible selfless person.

[12:33:20:06]
He's just I mean to know him I mean it's just not--  You know it's so rare too 'cause I grew up in the church and my dad's still a pastor you know.

[12:33:30:22]
He pastors a big church and you find that most congregants don't know the pastor and don't have interaction with the pastor I think the one thing we've found in making this is the connection that all of you feel to Pastor Bob.

[12:33:44:03]
And everyone said the same thing.

[12:33:45:19]
They said "Yeah you know you can't deny the similarities between Bob and Elvis and maybe that's why we came but we kind of don't care anymore."

[12:33:53:00]
Yeah I mean to me when I'm around him I don't even think about it anymore.

[12:33:57:23]
It's just fun.

[12:33:59:15]
I mean he goes after church and eats with a hundred people sometimes or more.

[12:34:05:01]
Yeah like we told you our goal with this I mean this is a story that's already out there.

[12:34:09:02]
We're not creating a story.

[12:34:10:03]
People are already talking about this you know?

[12:34:12:09]
And the good of that you found the church and everything that's out there you know?

[12:34:16:18]
And I think that again if people will you know watch this documentary or you know and it opens them up just to Bob's ministry sees what he's preaching and hear the message like their lives can be transformed too.

[12:34:30:00]
And you know that's one thing I think when you walk through the doors and he studies you.

[12:34:35:22]
It's like he looks through you with his eye.

[12:34:39:16]
It's like Pearson but after he gets to know you I mean that look is pretty much gone.

[12:34:45:04]
It's just wonderful.

[12:34:47:03]
Is he trying to suss out if you're just there for Elvis purposes?

[12:34:50:08]
I think that's his main goal.

[12:34:52:17]
And you know--  And if his background was fame and all that he's gonna have that right?

[12:34:57:18]
He's gonna be suspicious of who's around him.

[12:34:59:21]
Yeah.

[12:35:00:17]
From what I know of Elvis a small group of people around him.

[12:35:03:12]
And I can understand trust issues.

[12:35:05:08]
I mean in order to get where he was or is today I mean you couldn't trust hardly anybody.

[12:35:12:19]
Because one little leak could-- that's just mind-blowing.

[12:35:18:09]
Everyone tells us the first time you meet him he just looks through you.

[12:35:22:10]
Yeah.

[12:35:22:22]
Inside you.

[12:35:23:10]
And you're like oh.

[12:35:24:18]
I noticed like-- the first thing I noticed was that. and then the nose is like he's had work.

[12:35:31:02]
But that's the first thing I noticed just how deeply he wants to know people.

[12:35:39:15]
I mean it's incredible how he just walks every person.

[12:35:45:08]
There's probably two sides to that.

[12:35:46:11]
One he wants to truly know people but also he wants to say what you're here for.

[12:35:50:08]
Yeah and you know that was one of the first things or so he'd done.

[12:35:55:00]
You know I was telling Steve on the way over here He's like walking around he's like "It's all about Jesus."

[12:36:00:18]
He said "Nothing else matters around here."

[12:36:03:15]
And just to see the gifts people bring he just don't care.

[12:36:07:22]
It's just fabulous.

[12:36:10:17]
Just to know that he'd rather have just a simple he drove that old what the Ford truck forever they said.

[12:36:19:14]
And his wife while in it she drove that little Toyota car And they drove it forever didn't they?

[12:36:29:06]
Up till what about a year ago?

[12:36:31:23]
He finally got a little bit in your car.

[12:36:34:16]
It's interesting to think how much she has to be on board with this as well.

[12:36:38:00]
Yeah.

[12:36:39:10]
Just to know you know if he is who he is.

[12:36:42:19]
I mean the secrecy that you'd have to keep that long.

[12:36:46:19]
I just don't see how you could go that many years and just not want to say look But he loves entertaining people though.

[12:36:58:10]
He's just like that's his goal of just if it's gospel song I mean he'll sit there and sing all day.

[12:37:07:10]
He just constantly walks around and you can hear him singing just nonstop.

[12:37:12:09]
I don't know what he's singing because it's low a lot of times.

[12:37:16:21]
And I noticed that when the first couple of visits he'd just walk around church just singing away. and he's always got a smile.

[12:37:26:10]
Sometimes he gets frustrated but everybody does.

[12:37:29:19]
Did he ever talk about his musical history?

[12:37:32:07]
Not much does he?

[12:37:34:06]
I heard Wylena say that he sang at the Grand Ole Opry and he was up there tuning on his guitar but I don't know when that could have been.

[12:37:42:21]
But I just can't see him going anywhere singing and people not knowing 'cause the voices.

[12:37:52:12]
I mean you hear the voice online that's one thing but in person I mean it brings chills to you that this is fabulous.

[12:38:05:01]
And he's just he's funny he loves to aggravate you Steve.

[12:38:10:11]
He's constantly trying to Steve broke his leg roller skating and he'd give Steve the nickname Crip.

[12:38:19:01]
And then he took a Steve what was it Steve he borrowed your walking stick because it hurt his back or leg or something knee.

[12:38:31:00]
So he quit aggravating Steve after that now he gives him the nickname old man ain't it?

[12:38:37:20]
Awesome good great job sweet.

[12:38:42:11]
He's awesome though.

[12:38:44:06]
You get to know him and he's just fun.

[12:38:47:18]
When I'm around I don't even you don't think of it now.

[12:38:52:12]
And that's the fun part of knowing him was he could care less about what anybody thinks.

[12:38:59:17]
Which then makes you care less.

[12:39:01:03]
Yeah.

[12:39:02:16]
And just knowing him how he's kidding around he's always joking with Steve nonstop.

[12:39:09:18]
He at lunch one day he Steve what was it you broke a ceiling tile.

[12:39:17:07]
What was it?

[12:39:18:07]
He was aggravating Steve about his breaking the ceiling.

[12:39:22:07]
We've had a...
